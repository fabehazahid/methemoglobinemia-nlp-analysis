36304805,METHEMOGLOBINEMIA - A CASE REPORT  AND LITERATURE REVIEW.,"The objective of this case report is to present a patient with acquired methemoglobinemia due to poisoning of an unknown cause. A 55-year-old man was brought to the Emergency Department, University Hospital Center Zagreb, with an unwell appearance, cyanotic, restless, and presented with a quantitative consciousness disorder. An initial assessment showed decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2 85 [%]), while point-of-care arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis assessed normal partial pressure of oxygen (pO2). Severe lactic acidosis with a compensatory drop in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and high rates of methemoglobin were found. Supportive oxygen therapy and crystalloid solutions were administered, which resulted in rapid clinical recovery within 40 minutes of the initial assessment. Clinical recovery was accompanied by normalized ABG test results taken serially. Typical antidotes, methylene blue and vitamin C, were not administered due to rapid clinical improvement. Methemoglobinemia can be congenital (hereditary) or acquired (toxic). Both conditions are rarely seen in emergency departments, nevertheless, they should be approached properly since methemoglobinemia can be a severe, and fatal, condition. Methemoglobinemia symptoms are the results of inadequate oxygen transport. The diagnosis was confirmed by co-oximetry, while three clinical entities suspected methemoglobinemia: refractory hypoxia, ""cyanosis-saturation gap"" and dark brown blood. This paper reports our patient's clinical presentation, discusses the causes and mechanisms of possible poisoning, and reviews recent guidelines for methemoglobinemia management.",Acta clinica Croatica,2022,"Ivek I, Knotek T, Ivičić T",abstract_36304805.txt
33122582,Rasburicase-induced Methemoglobinemia: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme indicated for tumor lysis syndrome, a potential life-threatening oncologic emergency that occurs most commonly during initial chemotherapy for hematological malignancies. As a result of the defects in the physiological antioxidant pathway, erythrocytes of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are not protected against the oxidizing stress exerted by hydrogen peroxide generated with the administration of rasburicase. The authors report a 14-year-old patient, diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia with low oxygen saturation after starting steroids, hyperhydratation, and rasburicase administration.

37421600,Ascorbic Acid for Methemoglobinemia Treatment: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Ascorbic acid has been proposed as an alternative treatment for methemoglobinemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. However, its efficacy has never been compared to that of methylene blue given the inability of patients with G6PD deficiency to receive methylene blue. We present a case of methemoglobinemia treated with ascorbic acid in a patient without G6PD deficiency who had previously received methylene blue. <b>Summary:</b> A 66-year-old male was treated for methemoglobinemia deemed to be secondary to benzocaine throat spray. He received intravenous (IV) methylene blue but had a severe reaction: diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and hypotension. The infusion was stopped prior to completion. Approximately 6 days later he presented with methemoglobinemia following an additional overconsumption of benzocaine and was treated with ascorbic acid. In both instances his methemoglobin levels were >30% on arterial blood gas on admission and decreased to 6.5% and 7.8%, respectively, after administration of methylene blue and ascorbic acid. <b>Conclusion:</b> Ascorbic acid had a similar effect on decreasing the concentration of methemoglobin compared to methylene blue. Further research into use of ascorbic acid as a recommended agent for treatment of methemoglobinemia is warranted.",Journal of pharmacy practice,2024,"Keats KR, Robinson R, Patel M",abstract_37421600.txt

39984978,A blue blood toddler- a case report of methemoglobinemia and literature review.,"Methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition caused by oxidation of ferrous hemoglobin (Fe2+) to the ferric (Fe3+) state, making it incapable of binding oxygen and resulting in cyanosis and tissue ischemia. This case presentation describes a 1-year-old boy who developed sudden cyanosis and reduced consciousness disorder. An initial assessment showed decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2 85%) despite oxygen therapy, while point-of-care venous blood gas (VBG) analysis assessed high rates of MetHb (72.7%). Methylene blue and ascorbic acid were administered, resulting in in rapid clinical recovery and normalized VBG test results. The trigger for this condition was not identified, however the most likely cause of poisoning was attributed to food oxidants. Starting from the description of a clinical case, this paper discusses the causes and mechanisms of possible poisoning and reviews recent guidelines for methemoglobinemia management.",Italian journal of pediatrics,2025,"Pjetraj D, Mechri ME, Bacelli S",abstract_39984978.txt
41320991,Methemoglobinemia in Pregnancy: A Case Report and Comprehensive Review of the Literature.,"Methemoglobinemia causes hypoxia and can be congenital or acquired through chemical or drug exposure. Standard therapy for non-pregnant symptomatic cases is methylene blue, which poses potential fetal risks in pregnancy. We report a case of a pregnant patient with methemoglobinemia who presented with dyspnea at 18 weeks of gestation. Intravenous ascorbic acid was administered with resolution of dyspnea, and the patient was started on daily oral ascorbic acid upon discharge. With avoidance of potentially inciting agents, the patient proceeded to have a full-term, uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery of a viable female neonate. This report analyzes previously reported cases of methemoglobinemia in pregnancy, its pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and suggested management.

The disease necessitates avoidance of certain medications commonly used in obstetrics, making labor analgesia and anesthesia challenging. We present a case report of peripartum anesthetic management of a pregnant patient with congenital methemoglobinemia type 1 who received remifentanil labor analgesia and continuous methemoglobin monitoring. Continuous real-time monitoring of methemoglobin concentrations may prove to be a useful monitor in future care settings.

35725643,Methemoglobinemia due to use of poppers: a case report.,"Methemoglobinemia is an excess of oxidized hemoglobin in the blood, affecting oxygen transportation. It is characterized by central cyanosis that does not respond to oxygen therapy. Prognosis is excellent when treated adequately and rapidly. We present a case report of a 38-year-old Caucasian man suffering from methemoglobinemia due to the use of poppers. A 38-year-old Caucasian man known as a smoker and addicted to cocaine was admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea, agitation, and central cyanosis that started approximately 3 hours before admission. The persistent hypoxia despite high-flow oxygen therapy and a history of poppers use helped to reveal a condition known as methemoglobinemia. Our case highlighted a typical clinical presentation of methemoglobinemia. This possible life-threatening condition can occur after ingestion or inhalation of poppers, commonly sold in sex shops for recreational purposes. This can be easily confirmed by the methemoglobin level of the blood gases, provided the emergency physician considers this diagnosis. Rapid treatment with intravenous methylene blue is effective and leads to a favorable prognosis.",Journal of medical case reports,2022,"Sonck E, Bourmanne E, Bruteyn J",abstract_35725643.txt

There is restricted data on human poisoning. We report a case of an 18-year-old male patient without comorbidities presented with unconsciousness and cyanosis after the intentional ingestion of indoxacarb in a suicide attempt. Methemoglobinemia was clinically suspected and was successfully treated after methylene blue injection, associated with supportive and symptomatic management. This case emphasizes the importance of considering methemoglobinemia after indoxacarb ingestion in addition to its early recognition and timely injection of methylene blue which led to complete recovery without sequelae.",The Pan African medical journal,2024,"Braiek DB, Hidri R, Kaabi C",abstract_38799189.txt
39711837,Acquired methemoglobinemia in infancy secondary to diarrhea: a case report.,"Methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a life-threatening condition that reduces the oxygen-carrying ability of hemoglobin. Acquired methemoglobinemia usually results from exposure to specific oxidizing agents. Symptoms and complications depend on the MetHb level, which can sometimes be fatal. We present a case of a 6-week-old infant exhibiting hypoxia alongside gastroenteritis, fever, poor oral intake and low activity, with confirmed methemoglobinemia in blood gas analysis. Despite negative results in the workup for underlying causes, including genetic testing conducted later, methylene blue administration only partially reduced methemoglobinemia level. Treatment involved managing diarrhea by transitioning to a hydrolyzed formula. Interestingly, an incidental discovery of partial central venous sinus thrombosis occurred during the diagnostic process, although no established correlation with methemoglobinemia was evident in the literature. This case report illustrates the complex presentation of methemoglobinemia in a previously healthy infant, occurring concurrently with gastrointestinal infection and unexpected thrombosis. It underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and comprehensive management in addressing such multifaceted clinical scenarios in pediatric practice. This case emphasizes the importance of considering diarrhea as a possible cause of methemoglobinemia, especially in infancy. It also highlights the need for increased clinical awareness and prompt management approaches towards the various presentations of acquired methemoglobinemia in pediatric populations.",The Pan African medical journal,2024,"Aly MH, Bukhari HM, Aldirawi MAH",abstract_39711837.txt
20637402,Is threshold for treatment of methemoglobinemia the same for all? A case report and literature review.,"Acquired methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a rare complication of exposure to toxic chemicals or drugs, most commonly topical anesthetic agents. This condition occurs when the rate of methemoglobin production exceeds the rate of methemoglobin reduction. Topical anesthetics have been reported to cause MetHb, but this adverse event is extremely rare and is not usually listed as one of the possible complications of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). However, the number of published case reports of TEE-associated MetHb has recently increased. Benzocaine (ethyl aminobenzoate) is a topical anesthetic widely used for oropharyngeal anesthesia before TEE. Health care providers who are not familiar with the association of TEE and benzocaine-induced MetHb may not recognize the idiosyncratic and often nonspecific characteristics of this condition. Recognition is critical, as clinically important symptoms may occur at relatively low MetHb levels. If left untreated, MetHb can lead to cardiopulmonary compromise, severe neurologic impairment, and even death. The current report documents a case of TEE-associated MetHb from a high-volume (3000 cases per year including 300-350 TEEs per year) echo laboratory. Our patient was symptomatic and severely distressed, despite a MetHb level of only 10.8%. This case report emphasizes the importance of early recognition and treatment of MetHb, as it represents a medical emergency and can be severely symptomatic, especially in young children and the elderly, even with low MetHb levels.",The American journal of emergency medicine,2010,"El-Husseini A, Azarov N",abstract_20637402.txt
15106687,Dental anesthesia management of methemoglobinemia-susceptible patients: a case report and review of literature.,"A healthy but slightly pale 24-year-old female patient with a history of ""turning blue"" following dental procedures performed under local anesthesia claimed allergies to sulfa drugs, aspirin, Benadryl, and ""all caines."" The patient also acknowledged mild cyanosis after extreme exertion, Native American ancestry, and a 1996 diagnosis of methemoglobinemia following administration of a sulfa drug. Previous medical and dental records were reviewed. Restoration of several teeth and extraction of 2 third-molar teeth were completed under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, nasotracheal intubation was accomplished with succinylcholine, and anesthesia was maintained with desflurane in oxygen supplemented by meperidine without local anesthesia. Vital signs, including pulse oximetry, remained stable, and the patient was dismissed after a 2-hour recovery/observation period. The patient experienced no postoperative complications. This case report provides a review of literature and clinical guidelines for management of methemoglobinemia-susceptible patients.",Anesthesia progress,2004,"Hall DL, Moses MK, Weaver JM",abstract_15106687.txt

Topical anesthetics have been reported to cause methemoglobinemia, but this adverse event is extremely rare and has not been listed as one of the possible complications of TEE. However, recently the number of published case reports of TEE-associated methemoglobinemia has increased. Since its first description in 1950, 65 cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported including a recent report of five cases from a single center. Physicians who are not familiar with the association of TEE with benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia may not recognize the idiosyncratic and often nonspecific characteristic of this condition. Recognition is critical, however, since left untreated methemoglobinemia can lead to cardiopulmonary compromise, neurological sequelae, and even death. The current report documents an additional case of TEE-associated methemoglobinemia from a high-volume (8000 cases /year including 400-450 TEE/year) echo lab. A review of the literature suggests that this complication may be more prevalent, than generally appreciated.

37296483,Whole-blood ribonucleic acid sequencing analysis in methemoglobinemia: a case report.,"Methemoglobinemia is a condition in which methemoglobin is increased and the oxygen carrying capacity of tissues is decreased, causing a lack of oxygen to the whole body. RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequencing technologies have made it possible to systematically examine how the human transcriptome responds to invasive pathologies. To our knowledge, no previous studies have reported the results of RNA sequencing in a patient with methemoglobinemia. We describe the analysis of RNAs from the whole blood of a patient with methemoglobinemia. A 31-year-old Japanese man was brought to our hospital with symptoms of dyspnea due to inhalation of gas from an acetic acid phosphonitrate storage tank at a factory. The nitrogen oxide concentration measured around the storage tank was over 2500 ppm, and he witnessed orange-brown smoke at that time. After entering the area and taking a few breaths, he suddenly became unwell, with dyspnea and numbness in his extremities. He was evacuated from the area within a few minutes, at which time he was suffering from whole-body cyanosis and was still aware of the above symptoms. On arrival at the hospital, his respiration rate was 18 breaths/minute, and his SpO<sub>2</sub> ranged from 80% to 85% on 15 L/minute of oxygen by mask (2.5 hours postexposure). Arterial blood gas testing revealed a methemoglobin level of 23.1%. After the administration of methylene blue, the patient's methemoglobin level normalized and his symptoms improved. Chest X-ray and chest computed tomography showed no evidence of pulmonary edema or interstitial pneumonia, and no other abnormal findings were observed. RNA sequencing was performed on the blood samples obtained at the time of the visit, with the blood sample collected on day 5 used as a control. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to describe the analysis of RNAs from the whole blood of a patient with methemoglobinemia. The RNA sequencing analysis showed that an activated ""hydrogen peroxide catabolic process"" may be associated with the pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia. The results reported in the present study may explain the pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia.",Journal of medical case reports,2023,"Mitsuhara C, Togami Y, Hirose T",abstract_37296483.txt

However, 5-bromo-2-nitropyridine poisoning has not been previously reported. Here, we report the case of a 40-year-old man who suffered skin and respiratory tract exposure to leaked 5-Bromo-2-nitropyridine at work. After exposure, the patient rapidly developed dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, chest distress, diffuse cyanosis, and coma. Methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure were observed after admission. He improved markedly after treatment, but delayed encephalopathy was confirmed 82 days after the exposure.

The delayed diagnosis and treatment often cause further damage. The management of cellular hypoxemia is challenging and the use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has never been reported. The young patient, healthy with unremarkable past medical history, was sent to emergency room with out-of-hospital circulatory arrest (OHCA) and severe generalized cyanosis. His family reported he ingested sodium nitrite accidentally. After successful resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the paradoxically normal arterial blood gas (ABG) with the unusual brownish blood led to the suspicion of Met-Hb. The lab test confirmed it and showed a very high level of 80%. Because of recovered and normal cardiac function, we placed veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) for tissue hypoxemia in addition to exchange transfusion, vitamin C, and methylene blue. Met-Hb blood level dropped rapidly. After vigorous rehabilitation for weeks, the patient was able to be discharged home without major neurological sequela.

18853835,Methylene blue-induced methemoglobinemia during cardiopulmonary bypass? A case report and literature review.,"The guanylate cyclase (GC) and inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) inhibitor methylene blue (MB) has been used in cardiac surgery patients for the treatment of a variety of conditions. Methylene blue has been successfully used for the prevention and treatment of vasoplegia syndrome (VS) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Vasoplegia syndrome occurs in up to 10% of cardiac surgery patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Vasoplegia syndrome is described along with the results of studies that have shown benefits of MB in the treatment of VS. These studies include the use of MB prior to CPB, when added to the CPB prime and when given into the CPB circuit during the operation. We report a case of emergency CPB on a 55-year-old male with bacterial endocarditis, scheduled for an AVR/MVR who arrested on arrival to the operating room. Once on CPB the patient developed a profound hypotension despite normal to high pump flows, with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which was refractory to vasopressors--consistent with a diagnosis of VS. Unbeknownst to the perfusionist, the patient was treated with MB which was immediately followed by an apparent sudden arterial desaturation, despite oxygenator ventilation with 100% oxygen (O2), and development of severe metabolic acidosis. Troubleshooting the cause of the apparent desaturation and eventual diagnosis of a false indication of arterial oxygen desaturation and methemoglobinemia (MHgb) due to MB injection is described. Methemoglobinemia is explained as well as its presentation and treatment with MB. The importance of intraoperating room communication and knowledge of drug effects are discussed.",The journal of extra-corporeal technology,2008,"McRobb CM, Holt DW",abstract_18853835.txt

In most cases, methemoglobinemia is acquired and hereditary congenital methemoglobinemia is rare. Only a few case reports of congenital methemoglobinemia can be found in PubMed. To date, only four cases of congenital methemoglobinemia diagnosed after the age of 50 years have been reported. <i>Case Presentation</i>: A 79-year-old Japanese woman presented at our hospital with the chief complaints of dyspnea and cyanosis. She exhibited cyanosis of the lips and extremities, and her SpO<sub>2</sub> was 80%, with oxygen administration at 5 L/min. Blood gas analysis revealed a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 325.4 mmHg and methemoglobin level of 36.9%. The SpO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub> values were dissociated, and methemoglobin levels were markedly elevated. Genetic analysis revealed a nonsynonymous variant in the gene encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cytochrome (NADH) B5 reductase 3 (<i>CYB5R3</i>), and the patient was diagnosed with congenital methemoglobinemia. <i>Conclusions</i>: It is important to consider methemoglobinemia in the differential diagnosis of patients with central cyanosis.

38493134,Indoxacarb poisoning causing methemoglobinemia treated with parenteral vitamin C: a case report.,"This case study reports on a suicide attempt involving indoxacarb and vitamin C. Indoxacarb is a neurotoxic insecticide used in agriculture and as a flea controller in pets. Cotton, vegetables, and fruits are treated with indoxacarb, an insecticide that can be applied both indoors and outdoors. It causes skin allergies, methemoglobinemia, and hemolytic anemia. It is also attributed to allergic reactions through ingestion, inhalation, physical contact, and translaminar action. This case report highlights use of vitamin C in methemoglobinemia caused by indoxacarb poisoning. Indoxacarb poisoning has the potential to be extremely serious and even lethal. In this instance, the patient initially had no symptoms after ingesting a substance containing indoxacarb in an attempt at suicide. However, further tests revealed methemoglobinemia and low oxygen levels. A 28-year-old south-east Asian female patient ingested an insecticide containing 5.25% novaluron, 4.5% indoxacarb, and 25% thiamethoxam, and reported that she noticed muddy brown urine but presented with no active signs or symptoms of poisoning. Upon examination, the patient was fully conscious, alert, and hemodynamically stable, but had an oxygen saturation of 84%. Gastric lavage was performed, and blood investigations revealed a muddy-brown-colored blood sample and methemoglobin levels of 12%. The patient was treated with high-dose vitamin C and showed significant improvement, with a drop in methemoglobin levels to 1.2% and an increase in oxygen saturation to 97%. Indoxacarb poisoning can cause severe methemoglobinemia. Vitamin C may be a useful treatment option for methemoglobinemia caused by indoxacarb, particularly in cases in which traditional treatment with methylene blue is contraindicated or not tolerated. Hence high doses of ascorbic acid, that is, vitamin C, were administered to the patient, which lowered their methemoglobin levels and improved oxygen levels without much safety concerns. This example emphasizes the significance of early indoxacarb poisoning detection and treatment as well as the possible advantages of utilizing ascorbic acid in the management of methemoglobinemia, and highlights the use of vitamin C in the treatment of methemoglobinemia caused by indoxacarb poisoning. Therefore, it is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of the potential for indoxacarb to cause methemoglobinemia and to consider vitamin C as a treatment option.",Journal of medical case reports,2024,"Sivanandam LK, Arunkumar H, Marlecha P",abstract_38493134.txt

The complete blood count revealed normocytic normochromic anemia with a sometimes-elevated reticulocyte count, and the bone marrow cytology showed marked erythroid hyperplasia, but the tests related to hemolysis were normal. Therefore, the whole exome sequencing was performed and showed a heterozygous mutation for HBB: c.85 C > A. With asymptomatic methemoglobinemia confirmed later, she was eventually diagnosed with Hb Chile. This is the first report of Hb Chile in China and the second worldwide. This case shows that Hb Chile is clinically heterogeneous and difficult to diagnose and expands our understanding on the clinical and hematological traits of the disease.",BMC pediatrics,2023,"Gong Y, Zheng Q, Long S",abstract_38110882.txt
39256769,Rapid-onset methemoglobinemia from traditional-medicine-induced potassium nitrate poisoning: successful treatment with methylene blue-a case report.,"Potassium nitrate poisoning is a rare but potentially serious condition that can result in methemoglobinemia and subsequent cyanosis. This case report presents a unique instance of rapid-onset methemoglobinemia resulting from the ingestion of a traditional medicine preparation containing potassium nitrate, known as ""kalmi shora."" A 14-year-old Pakistani boy reported to the emergency department with a history of sudden-onset headache, drowsiness agitation, irritability, and generalized cyanosis. Pulse oximetry showed a concerning oxygen saturation level of 58%, whereas arterial blood gas analysis revealed a normal partial pressure of oxygen (90 mmHg). The profile of abrupt onset of symptoms, generalized cyanosis, and the discrepancy between the partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation readings necessitated a comprehensive assessment including inquiries into potential toxins. The peculiar appearance of the blood, resembling chocolate in color, further indicated the possibility of methemoglobinemia. The patient was successfully treated with methylene blue, leading to a prompt resolution of symptoms. This case highlights the significance of considering toxin exposures, such as traditional-medicine-induced poisoning, in emergency settings. The report contributes to the medical literature by highlighting the potential risks associated with traditional remedies and emphasizes the critical role of prompt diagnosis and intervention in optimizing patient outcomes. Recognition of the specific etiology of methemoglobinemia, in this case, traditional medicine ingestion, is essential for effective management in emergency medicine.",Journal of medical case reports,2024,"Kazmi S, Farooqi H, Nawaz A",abstract_39256769.txt
