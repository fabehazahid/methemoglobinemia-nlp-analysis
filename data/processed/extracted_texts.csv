Title: Methemoglobinemia induced by topical anesthesia: a case report and review.
Journal: The American journal of the medical sciences
Year: 1999
Authors: Khan NA, Kruse JA

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Topical anesthetic drugs are widely used by clinicians during hospital and outpatient procedures and are also available to the public in a variety of over-the-counter preparations. Although generally safe, they may cause potentially life-threatening methemoglobinemia. We describe a patient who developed repeated episodes of severe methemoglobinemia after administration of topical Cetacaine spray (a proprietary mixture of benzocaine, tetracaine, and butamben) employed for pharyngeal anesthesia before endotracheal intubation, and briefly review the etiology and pathophysiology of this disorder. Cautious interpretation of oxyhemoglobin saturation values obtained by pulse oximetry or estimated from arterial blood gas analysis is crucial lest the diagnosis of severe methemoglobinemia and the resulting hypoxemia are overlooked. If necessary, the condition is usually readily corrected by intravenous administration of methylene blue."

Title: Dental anesthesia management of methemoglobinemia-susceptible patients: a case report and review of literature.
Journal: Anesthesia progress
Year: 2004
Authors: Hall DL, Moses MK, Weaver JM

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
A healthy but slightly pale 24-year-old female patient with a history of ""turning blue"" following dental procedures performed under local anesthesia claimed allergies to sulfa drugs, aspirin, Benadryl, and ""all caines."" The patient also acknowledged mild cyanosis after extreme exertion, Native American ancestry, and a 1996 diagnosis of methemoglobinemia following administration of a sulfa drug. Previous medical and dental records were reviewed. Restoration of several teeth and extraction of 2 third-molar teeth were completed under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, nasotracheal intubation was accomplished with succinylcholine, and anesthesia was maintained with desflurane in oxygen supplemented by meperidine without local anesthesia. Vital signs, including pulse oximetry, remained stable, and the patient was dismissed after a 2-hour recovery/observation period. The patient experienced no postoperative complications. This case report provides a review of literature and clinical guidelines for management of methemoglobinemia-susceptible patients."

Title: Methemoglobinemia following transesophageal echocardiography: a case report and review.
Journal: Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)
Year: 2006
Authors: BheemReddy S, Messineo F, Roychoudhury D

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Benzocaine (ethyl aminobenzoate) is a topical anesthetic widely used for oropharyngeal anesthesia prior to transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Topical anesthetics have been reported to cause methemoglobinemia, but this adverse event is extremely rare and has not been listed as one of the possible complications of TEE. However, recently the number of published case reports of TEE-associated methemoglobinemia has increased. Since its first description in 1950, 65 cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported including a recent report of five cases from a single center. Physicians who are not familiar with the association of TEE with benzocaine-induced methemoglobinemia may not recognize the idiosyncratic and often nonspecific characteristic of this condition. Recognition is critical, however, since left untreated methemoglobinemia can lead to cardiopulmonary compromise, neurological sequelae, and even death. The current report documents an additional case of TEE-associated methemoglobinemia from a high-volume (8000 cases /year including 400-450 TEE/year) echo lab. A review of the literature suggests that this complication may be more prevalent, than generally appreciated. This case report emphasizes the importance of appropriate dose, recognition, and the treatment of this entity to cardiologists performing TEE."

Title: Methylene blue-induced methemoglobinemia during cardiopulmonary bypass? A case report and literature review.
Journal: The journal of extra-corporeal technology
Year: 2008
Authors: McRobb CM, Holt DW

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
The guanylate cyclase (GC) and inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) inhibitor methylene blue (MB) has been used in cardiac surgery patients for the treatment of a variety of conditions. Methylene blue has been successfully used for the prevention and treatment of vasoplegia syndrome (VS) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Vasoplegia syndrome occurs in up to 10% of cardiac surgery patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Vasoplegia syndrome is described along with the results of studies that have shown benefits of MB in the treatment of VS. These studies include the use of MB prior to CPB, when added to the CPB prime and when given into the CPB circuit during the operation. We report a case of emergency CPB on a 55-year-old male with bacterial endocarditis, scheduled for an AVR/MVR who arrested on arrival to the operating room. Once on CPB the patient developed a profound hypotension despite normal to high pump flows, with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which was refractory to vasopressors--consistent with a diagnosis of VS. Unbeknownst to the perfusionist, the patient was treated with MB which was immediately followed by an apparent sudden arterial desaturation, despite oxygenator ventilation with 100% oxygen (O2), and development of severe metabolic acidosis. Troubleshooting the cause of the apparent desaturation and eventual diagnosis of a false indication of arterial oxygen desaturation and methemoglobinemia (MHgb) due to MB injection is described. Methemoglobinemia is explained as well as its presentation and treatment with MB. The importance of intraoperating room communication and knowledge of drug effects are discussed."

Title: Severe hemolysis and methemoglobinemia following fava beans ingestion in glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase deficiency: case report and literature review.
Journal: European journal of pediatrics
Year: 2009
Authors: Schuurman M, van Waardenburg D, Da Costa J

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Reduced concentrations of glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (G6PD) render erythrocytes susceptible to hemolysis under conditions of oxidative stress. In favism, the ingestion of fava beans induces an oxidative stress to erythrocytes, leading to acute hemolysis. The simultaneous occurrence of methemoglobinemia has been reported only scarcely, despite the fact that both phenomena are the consequence of a common pathophysiologic mechanism. The presence of methemoglobinemia has important diagnostic and therapeutic consequences. We report a previously healthy boy who presented with combined severe hemolytic anemia and cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia, following the ingestion of fava beans. His condition was complicated by the development of transient acute renal failure. A G6PD-deficiency was diagnosed. We review the literature on the combination of acute hemolysis and methemoglobinemia in favism. Pathophysiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic aspects of this disorder are discussed."

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia; an increased concentration of methemoglobin in the blood, is an altered state of hemoglobin whereby the ferrous form of iron is oxidized to the ferric state, rendering the heme moiety incapable of carrying oxygen. The authors present a case of 49-year-old man who was admitted to the department of chest medicine with dyspnea, weakness and cyanosis in whom differential diagnosis excluded acute and chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Clinical cyanosis and low measured oxygen saturation in the presence of normal arterial oxygen tension was highly suggestive of methemoglobinemia (""saturation gap""). Methemoglobin level, measured at the acute phase of disease was elevated at 16%. Episode resolved spontaneously. Causes of methemoglobinemia was not established."

Title: Is threshold for treatment of methemoglobinemia the same for all? A case report and literature review.
Journal: The American journal of emergency medicine
Year: 2010
Authors: El-Husseini A, Azarov N

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Acquired methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a rare complication of exposure to toxic chemicals or drugs, most commonly topical anesthetic agents. This condition occurs when the rate of methemoglobin production exceeds the rate of methemoglobin reduction. Topical anesthetics have been reported to cause MetHb, but this adverse event is extremely rare and is not usually listed as one of the possible complications of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). However, the number of published case reports of TEE-associated MetHb has recently increased. Benzocaine (ethyl aminobenzoate) is a topical anesthetic widely used for oropharyngeal anesthesia before TEE. Health care providers who are not familiar with the association of TEE and benzocaine-induced MetHb may not recognize the idiosyncratic and often nonspecific characteristics of this condition. Recognition is critical, as clinically important symptoms may occur at relatively low MetHb levels. If left untreated, MetHb can lead to cardiopulmonary compromise, severe neurologic impairment, and even death. The current report documents a case of TEE-associated MetHb from a high-volume (3000 cases per year including 300-350 TEEs per year) echo laboratory. Our patient was symptomatic and severely distressed, despite a MetHb level of only 10.8%. This case report emphasizes the importance of early recognition and treatment of MetHb, as it represents a medical emergency and can be severely symptomatic, especially in young children and the elderly, even with low MetHb levels."

Title: A Case Report of Benzocaine-Induced Methemoglobinemia.
Journal: Journal of pharmacy practice
Year: 2018
Authors: Sewell CR, Rivey MP

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia is a serious medical condition characterized by the disrupted binding of oxygen to iron on hemoglobin, with a consequent impaired oxygen delivery to body tissues. Various drugs including the local anesthetics such as benzocaine can cause acquired methemoglobinemia. The reported case describes methemoglobinemia that occurred in association with the use of topical benzocaine spray and lozenges in a previously healthy 51-year-old female who had undergone colon surgery to remove a bleeding polyp. Pulse oximetry revealed the patient was hypoxic and a measured methemoglobin (MetHB) serum concentration was 32.4%, well above the normal of less than 2%. Treatment with intravenous methylene blue resulted in a rapid improvement in the patient's respiratory status. The case emphasizes the need for practitioners to appreciate that topical benzocaine products can cause potentially fatal methemoglobinemia."

Journal: A&A practice
Year: 2020
Authors: Faisal H, Bloom A, Gaber AO

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia is a rare disorder of the blood in which there is an increase in methemoglobin, which occurs when hemoglobin is present in the oxidized form. Methemoglobin impairs hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen, produces functional anemia, and leads to tissue hypoxia. We report the successful management of a case of refractory hypoxia due to acutely acquired methemoglobinemia in a patient undergoing treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. The cause of methemoglobinemia in this patient remains unknown. Hypoxia and methemoglobinemia did not respond to methylene blue and required administration of packed red blood cell transfusions."

Authors: Pirrone I, Farruggia P, Cacciatore F

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme indicated for tumor lysis syndrome, a potential life-threatening oncologic emergency that occurs most commonly during initial chemotherapy for hematological malignancies. As a result of the defects in the physiological antioxidant pathway, erythrocytes of patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are not protected against the oxidizing stress exerted by hydrogen peroxide generated with the administration of rasburicase. The authors report a 14-year-old patient, diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia with low oxygen saturation after starting steroids, hyperhydratation, and rasburicase administration. The complications resolved with supportive therapy only."

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Congenital methemoglobinemia is a rare disease characterized by cyanosis and a left shifting of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. The disease necessitates avoidance of certain medications commonly used in obstetrics, making labor analgesia and anesthesia challenging. We present a case report of peripartum anesthetic management of a pregnant patient with congenital methemoglobinemia type 1 who received remifentanil labor analgesia and continuous methemoglobin monitoring. Continuous real-time monitoring of methemoglobin concentrations may prove to be a useful monitor in future care settings. A review of literature encompassing various perioperative and obstetric anesthesia and analgesia management considerations is presented."

Title: A case report of acquired methemoglobinemia rescued by veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
Journal: Medicine
Year: 2021
Authors: Lien YH, Lin YC, Chen RJ

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Severe methemoglobinemia (Met-Hb) is rare. The delayed diagnosis and treatment often cause further damage. The management of cellular hypoxemia is challenging and the use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has never been reported. The young patient, healthy with unremarkable past medical history, was sent to emergency room with out-of-hospital circulatory arrest (OHCA) and severe generalized cyanosis. His family reported he ingested sodium nitrite accidentally. After successful resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the paradoxically normal arterial blood gas (ABG) with the unusual brownish blood led to the suspicion of Met-Hb. The lab test confirmed it and showed a very high level of 80%. Because of recovered and normal cardiac function, we placed veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) for tissue hypoxemia in addition to exchange transfusion, vitamin C, and methylene blue. Met-Hb blood level dropped rapidly. After vigorous rehabilitation for weeks, the patient was able to be discharged home without major neurological sequela. VV-ECMO can hyper-oxygenate the hypoxemic tissue regardless the etiology and minimize hypoxemia-reperfusion injury while awaiting the definite diagnosis and therapy."

Title: Methemoglobinemia due to use of poppers: a case report.
Journal: Journal of medical case reports
Year: 2022
Authors: Sonck E, Bourmanne E, Bruteyn J

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia is an excess of oxidized hemoglobin in the blood, affecting oxygen transportation. It is characterized by central cyanosis that does not respond to oxygen therapy. Prognosis is excellent when treated adequately and rapidly. We present a case report of a 38-year-old Caucasian man suffering from methemoglobinemia due to the use of poppers. A 38-year-old Caucasian man known as a smoker and addicted to cocaine was admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea, agitation, and central cyanosis that started approximately 3 hours before admission. The persistent hypoxia despite high-flow oxygen therapy and a history of poppers use helped to reveal a condition known as methemoglobinemia. Our case highlighted a typical clinical presentation of methemoglobinemia. This possible life-threatening condition can occur after ingestion or inhalation of poppers, commonly sold in sex shops for recreational purposes. This can be easily confirmed by the methemoglobin level of the blood gases, provided the emergency physician considers this diagnosis. Rapid treatment with intravenous methylene blue is effective and leads to a favorable prognosis."

Title: Methemoglobinemia and Delayed Encephalopathy After 5-Bromo-2-Nitropyridine Poisoning: A Rare Case Report.
Journal: Frontiers in public health
Year: 2022
Authors: Shi L, Yu G, Zhao L

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
5-bromo-2-nitropyridine, an intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceutical and pesticide products, is toxic to the human body. However, 5-bromo-2-nitropyridine poisoning has not been previously reported. Here, we report the case of a 40-year-old man who suffered skin and respiratory tract exposure to leaked 5-Bromo-2-nitropyridine at work. After exposure, the patient rapidly developed dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, chest distress, diffuse cyanosis, and coma. Methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure were observed after admission. He improved markedly after treatment, but delayed encephalopathy was confirmed 82 days after the exposure. This case highlights that 5-bromo-2-nitropyridine can be absorbed through the skin and respiratory tract, resulting in methemoglobinemia and delayed encephalopathy."

Title: METHEMOGLOBINEMIA - A CASE REPORT  AND LITERATURE REVIEW.
Journal: Acta clinica Croatica
Year: 2022

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
The objective of this case report is to present a patient with acquired methemoglobinemia due to poisoning of an unknown cause. A 55-year-old man was brought to the Emergency Department, University Hospital Center Zagreb, with an unwell appearance, cyanotic, restless, and presented with a quantitative consciousness disorder. An initial assessment showed decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2 85 [%]), while point-of-care arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis assessed normal partial pressure of oxygen (pO2). Severe lactic acidosis with a compensatory drop in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and high rates of methemoglobin were found. Supportive oxygen therapy and crystalloid solutions were administered, which resulted in rapid clinical recovery within 40 minutes of the initial assessment. Clinical recovery was accompanied by normalized ABG test results taken serially. Typical antidotes, methylene blue and vitamin C, were not administered due to rapid clinical improvement. Methemoglobinemia can be congenital (hereditary) or acquired (toxic). Both conditions are rarely seen in emergency departments, nevertheless, they should be approached properly since methemoglobinemia can be a severe, and fatal, condition. Methemoglobinemia symptoms are the results of inadequate oxygen transport. The diagnosis was confirmed by co-oximetry, while three clinical entities suspected methemoglobinemia: refractory hypoxia, ""cyanosis-saturation gap"" and dark brown blood. This paper reports our patient's clinical presentation, discusses the causes and mechanisms of possible poisoning, and reviews recent guidelines for methemoglobinemia management."

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia is a common complication of dapsone poisoning. Its´ treatment usually relies on methylene blue infusion. The aim of this study was to report a case of an acute dapsone poisoning with methemoglobinemia treated only with ascorbic acid and activated charcoal. A 16-year-old female voluntary ingested 3 grams of dapsone in an attempt of suicide and presented with desaturation and tachypnea. Lab findings were compatible with methemoglobinemia. After two days of treatment with ascorbic acid and activated charcoal, we observed the disappearance of desaturation and tachypnea. Methemoglobinemia can be treated with ascorbic acid and activated charcoal in limited resource settings."

Title: A Case Report of Hypotension and Methemoglobinemia Associated With Gunshot Residue Poisoning: Nitrite-Induced Methemoglobinemia.
Journal: A&A practice
Year: 2022
Authors: Pugh DB, Saxena A, Barta LE

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
A patient with gunshots within inches of the skin developed intraoperative vasodilatory hypotension and methemoglobinemia, both recognized consequences of nitrite poisoning. A 1- mg/kg dose of methylene blue transiently and partially reversed methemoglobinemia, but the color of the methylene blue faded rapidly, consistent with bleaching of methylene blue by nitrite in vivo. Methylene blue did not raise blood pressure, consistent with inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Because NO production from nitrite uses an NO synthase (NOS)-independent pathway, methylene blue is expected to have little effect on reversing hypotension from nitrite poisoning. Consider nitrite toxicity in gunshot patients with refractory vasodilatory hypotension and elevated methemoglobin."

Title: Hereditary Congenital Methemoglobinemia Diagnosed at the Age of 79 Years: A Case Report.
Journal: Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)
Year: 2023
Authors: Nakata M, Yokota N, Tabata K

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
<i>Background</i>: Cardiopulmonary disorders are the most common cause of central cyanosis, and methemoglobinemia is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of patients with central cyanosis. In most cases, methemoglobinemia is acquired and hereditary congenital methemoglobinemia is rare. Only a few case reports of congenital methemoglobinemia can be found in PubMed. To date, only four cases of congenital methemoglobinemia diagnosed after the age of 50 years have been reported. <i>Case Presentation</i>: A 79-year-old Japanese woman presented at our hospital with the chief complaints of dyspnea and cyanosis. She exhibited cyanosis of the lips and extremities, and her SpO<sub>2</sub> was 80%, with oxygen administration at 5 L/min. Blood gas analysis revealed a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 325.4 mmHg and methemoglobin level of 36.9%. The SpO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub> values were dissociated, and methemoglobin levels were markedly elevated. Genetic analysis revealed a nonsynonymous variant in the gene encoding nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cytochrome (NADH) B5 reductase 3 (<i>CYB5R3</i>), and the patient was diagnosed with congenital methemoglobinemia. <i>Conclusions</i>: It is important to consider methemoglobinemia in the differential diagnosis of patients with central cyanosis. At 79 years of age, our patient represents the oldest patient with this diagnosis. This report indicates that it is crucial to consider the possibility of methemoglobinemia regardless of the patient's age."

Title: Whole-blood ribonucleic acid sequencing analysis in methemoglobinemia: a case report.
Journal: Journal of medical case reports
Year: 2023
Authors: Mitsuhara C, Togami Y, Hirose T

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia is a condition in which methemoglobin is increased and the oxygen carrying capacity of tissues is decreased, causing a lack of oxygen to the whole body. RNA (ribonucleic acid) sequencing technologies have made it possible to systematically examine how the human transcriptome responds to invasive pathologies. To our knowledge, no previous studies have reported the results of RNA sequencing in a patient with methemoglobinemia. We describe the analysis of RNAs from the whole blood of a patient with methemoglobinemia. A 31-year-old Japanese man was brought to our hospital with symptoms of dyspnea due to inhalation of gas from an acetic acid phosphonitrate storage tank at a factory. The nitrogen oxide concentration measured around the storage tank was over 2500 ppm, and he witnessed orange-brown smoke at that time. After entering the area and taking a few breaths, he suddenly became unwell, with dyspnea and numbness in his extremities. He was evacuated from the area within a few minutes, at which time he was suffering from whole-body cyanosis and was still aware of the above symptoms. On arrival at the hospital, his respiration rate was 18 breaths/minute, and his SpO<sub>2</sub> ranged from 80% to 85% on 15 L/minute of oxygen by mask (2.5 hours postexposure). Arterial blood gas testing revealed a methemoglobin level of 23.1%. After the administration of methylene blue, the patient's methemoglobin level normalized and his symptoms improved. Chest X-ray and chest computed tomography showed no evidence of pulmonary edema or interstitial pneumonia, and no other abnormal findings were observed. RNA sequencing was performed on the blood samples obtained at the time of the visit, with the blood sample collected on day 5 used as a control. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to describe the analysis of RNAs from the whole blood of a patient with methemoglobinemia. The RNA sequencing analysis showed that an activated ""hydrogen peroxide catabolic process"" may be associated with the pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia. The results reported in the present study may explain the pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia."

Title: Ascorbic Acid for Methemoglobinemia Treatment: A Case Report and Literature Review.
Journal: Journal of pharmacy practice
Year: 2024
Authors: Keats KR, Robinson R, Patel M

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
<b>Purpose:</b> Ascorbic acid has been proposed as an alternative treatment for methemoglobinemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. However, its efficacy has never been compared to that of methylene blue given the inability of patients with G6PD deficiency to receive methylene blue. We present a case of methemoglobinemia treated with ascorbic acid in a patient without G6PD deficiency who had previously received methylene blue. <b>Summary:</b> A 66-year-old male was treated for methemoglobinemia deemed to be secondary to benzocaine throat spray. He received intravenous (IV) methylene blue but had a severe reaction: diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and hypotension. The infusion was stopped prior to completion. Approximately 6 days later he presented with methemoglobinemia following an additional overconsumption of benzocaine and was treated with ascorbic acid. In both instances his methemoglobin levels were >30% on arterial blood gas on admission and decreased to 6.5% and 7.8%, respectively, after administration of methylene blue and ascorbic acid. <b>Conclusion:</b> Ascorbic acid had a similar effect on decreasing the concentration of methemoglobin compared to methylene blue. Further research into use of ascorbic acid as a recommended agent for treatment of methemoglobinemia is warranted."

Title: The first Chinese with Hb Chile leading to chronic anemia and methemoglobinemia: a case report.
Journal: BMC pediatrics
Year: 2023
Authors: Gong Y, Zheng Q, Long S

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Hemoglobin (Hb) Chile [β28(B10) Leu > Met; HBB: c.85 C > A] is a rare hemoglobin variant caused by a missense mutation in the HBB gene. Only one case of Hb Chile has been reported worldwide so far. It is an unstable hemoglobin, characterized by cyanosis associated with chronic methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia induced by sulfonamides or methylene blue. A 9-year-3-month-old girl had mild anemia of unknown etiology for more than 6 years. She had a slight pallor without other symptoms or signs. The complete blood count revealed normocytic normochromic anemia with a sometimes-elevated reticulocyte count, and the bone marrow cytology showed marked erythroid hyperplasia, but the tests related to hemolysis were normal. Therefore, the whole exome sequencing was performed and showed a heterozygous mutation for HBB: c.85 C > A. With asymptomatic methemoglobinemia confirmed later, she was eventually diagnosed with Hb Chile. This is the first report of Hb Chile in China and the second worldwide. This case shows that Hb Chile is clinically heterogeneous and difficult to diagnose and expands our understanding on the clinical and hematological traits of the disease."

Title: Indoxacarb poisoning causing methemoglobinemia treated with parenteral vitamin C: a case report.
Journal: Journal of medical case reports
Year: 2024
Authors: Sivanandam LK, Arunkumar H, Marlecha P

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
This case study reports on a suicide attempt involving indoxacarb and vitamin C. Indoxacarb is a neurotoxic insecticide used in agriculture and as a flea controller in pets. Cotton, vegetables, and fruits are treated with indoxacarb, an insecticide that can be applied both indoors and outdoors. It causes skin allergies, methemoglobinemia, and hemolytic anemia. It is also attributed to allergic reactions through ingestion, inhalation, physical contact, and translaminar action. This case report highlights use of vitamin C in methemoglobinemia caused by indoxacarb poisoning. Indoxacarb poisoning has the potential to be extremely serious and even lethal. In this instance, the patient initially had no symptoms after ingesting a substance containing indoxacarb in an attempt at suicide. However, further tests revealed methemoglobinemia and low oxygen levels. A 28-year-old south-east Asian female patient ingested an insecticide containing 5.25% novaluron, 4.5% indoxacarb, and 25% thiamethoxam, and reported that she noticed muddy brown urine but presented with no active signs or symptoms of poisoning. Upon examination, the patient was fully conscious, alert, and hemodynamically stable, but had an oxygen saturation of 84%. Gastric lavage was performed, and blood investigations revealed a muddy-brown-colored blood sample and methemoglobin levels of 12%. The patient was treated with high-dose vitamin C and showed significant improvement, with a drop in methemoglobin levels to 1.2% and an increase in oxygen saturation to 97%. Indoxacarb poisoning can cause severe methemoglobinemia. Vitamin C may be a useful treatment option for methemoglobinemia caused by indoxacarb, particularly in cases in which traditional treatment with methylene blue is contraindicated or not tolerated. Hence high doses of ascorbic acid, that is, vitamin C, were administered to the patient, which lowered their methemoglobin levels and improved oxygen levels without much safety concerns. This example emphasizes the significance of early indoxacarb poisoning detection and treatment as well as the possible advantages of utilizing ascorbic acid in the management of methemoglobinemia, and highlights the use of vitamin C in the treatment of methemoglobinemia caused by indoxacarb poisoning. Therefore, it is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of the potential for indoxacarb to cause methemoglobinemia and to consider vitamin C as a treatment option."

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Indoxacarb, a large-spectrum non-organophosphorus oxadiazine insecticide, is broadly used in farming whose mechanism of action is the blockage of voltage-gated sodium channels of insects. There is restricted data on human poisoning. We report a case of an 18-year-old male patient without comorbidities presented with unconsciousness and cyanosis after the intentional ingestion of indoxacarb in a suicide attempt. Methemoglobinemia was clinically suspected and was successfully treated after methylene blue injection, associated with supportive and symptomatic management. This case emphasizes the importance of considering methemoglobinemia after indoxacarb ingestion in addition to its early recognition and timely injection of methylene blue which led to complete recovery without sequelae."

Title: Rapid-onset methemoglobinemia from traditional-medicine-induced potassium nitrate poisoning: successful treatment with methylene blue-a case report.
Journal: Journal of medical case reports
Year: 2024

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Potassium nitrate poisoning is a rare but potentially serious condition that can result in methemoglobinemia and subsequent cyanosis. This case report presents a unique instance of rapid-onset methemoglobinemia resulting from the ingestion of a traditional medicine preparation containing potassium nitrate, known as ""kalmi shora."" A 14-year-old Pakistani boy reported to the emergency department with a history of sudden-onset headache, drowsiness agitation, irritability, and generalized cyanosis. Pulse oximetry showed a concerning oxygen saturation level of 58%, whereas arterial blood gas analysis revealed a normal partial pressure of oxygen (90 mmHg). The profile of abrupt onset of symptoms, generalized cyanosis, and the discrepancy between the partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation readings necessitated a comprehensive assessment including inquiries into potential toxins. The peculiar appearance of the blood, resembling chocolate in color, further indicated the possibility of methemoglobinemia. The patient was successfully treated with methylene blue, leading to a prompt resolution of symptoms. This case highlights the significance of considering toxin exposures, such as traditional-medicine-induced poisoning, in emergency settings. The report contributes to the medical literature by highlighting the potential risks associated with traditional remedies and emphasizes the critical role of prompt diagnosis and intervention in optimizing patient outcomes. Recognition of the specific etiology of methemoglobinemia, in this case, traditional medicine ingestion, is essential for effective management in emergency medicine."

Title: Acquired methemoglobinemia in infancy secondary to diarrhea: a case report.

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a life-threatening condition that reduces the oxygen-carrying ability of hemoglobin. Acquired methemoglobinemia usually results from exposure to specific oxidizing agents. Symptoms and complications depend on the MetHb level, which can sometimes be fatal. We present a case of a 6-week-old infant exhibiting hypoxia alongside gastroenteritis, fever, poor oral intake and low activity, with confirmed methemoglobinemia in blood gas analysis. Despite negative results in the workup for underlying causes, including genetic testing conducted later, methylene blue administration only partially reduced methemoglobinemia level. Treatment involved managing diarrhea by transitioning to a hydrolyzed formula. Interestingly, an incidental discovery of partial central venous sinus thrombosis occurred during the diagnostic process, although no established correlation with methemoglobinemia was evident in the literature. This case report illustrates the complex presentation of methemoglobinemia in a previously healthy infant, occurring concurrently with gastrointestinal infection and unexpected thrombosis. It underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and comprehensive management in addressing such multifaceted clinical scenarios in pediatric practice. This case emphasizes the importance of considering diarrhea as a possible cause of methemoglobinemia, especially in infancy. It also highlights the need for increased clinical awareness and prompt management approaches towards the various presentations of acquired methemoglobinemia in pediatric populations."

================================================================================

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition caused by oxidation of ferrous hemoglobin (Fe2+) to the ferric (Fe3+) state, making it incapable of binding oxygen and resulting in cyanosis and tissue ischemia. This case presentation describes a 1-year-old boy who developed sudden cyanosis and reduced consciousness disorder. An initial assessment showed decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2 85%) despite oxygen therapy, while point-of-care venous blood gas (VBG) analysis assessed high rates of MetHb (72.7%). Methylene blue and ascorbic acid were administered, resulting in in rapid clinical recovery and normalized VBG test results. The trigger for this condition was not identified, however the most likely cause of poisoning was attributed to food oxidants. Starting from the description of a clinical case, this paper discusses the causes and mechanisms of possible poisoning and reviews recent guidelines for methemoglobinemia management."

ABSTRACT:
Methemoglobinemia causes hypoxia and can be congenital or acquired through chemical or drug exposure. Standard therapy for non-pregnant symptomatic cases is methylene blue, which poses potential fetal risks in pregnancy. We report a case of a pregnant patient with methemoglobinemia who presented with dyspnea at 18 weeks of gestation. Intravenous ascorbic acid was administered with resolution of dyspnea, and the patient was started on daily oral ascorbic acid upon discharge. With avoidance of potentially inciting agents, the patient proceeded to have a full-term, uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery of a viable female neonate. This report analyzes previously reported cases of methemoglobinemia in pregnancy, its pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and suggested management. Daily ascorbic acid may be a feasible alternative to methylene blue for the management of symptomatic methemoglobinemia in pregnancy."

Methemoglobinemia is a common complication of 
dapsone poisoning. Its´ treatment usually relies on 
methylene blue infusion. The aim of this study was 
to report a case of an acute dapsone poisoning 
with methemoglobinemia treated only with 
ascorbic acid and activated charcoal. A 16 -year -old 
female voluntary ingested 3 grams of dapsone in 
an attempt  of suicide and presented with 
desaturation and tachypnea. Lab findings were 
compatible with methemoglobinemia. After two 
days of treatment with ascorbic acid and activated 
charcoal, we observed the disappearance of 
desaturation and tachypnea . Methemoglobi nemia

can be treated with ascorbic acid and activated 
charcoal in limited resource settings.  
Introduction     
Methemoglobinemia is defined by a level of 
methemoglobin superior to 1 .5 g/dl [ 1]. It is a life 
threatening situation in which the severity of 
symptoms depends on the methemoglobin levels. 
It can be caused by exposure to dapsone [ 2]. The 
diagnosis relies on arterial or venous gas with co -
oximetry and its management implies methy lene 
blue infusion. We present a case of a 16 -year -old 
female with acute dapsone poisoning presenting  
with methemoglobinemia, treated by ascorbic acid 
and activated charcoal rather than methylene 
blue, with a good outcome.  
Patient and observation      
Patient information:  a 16 -year -old female with no 
medical history was admitted to the intensive care 
unit of the emergency department, 9 hours after 
the voluntary ingestion of 3 grams of dapsone, in 
an attempt of suicide. The parents report a violent 
conflict with their daughter and the patient 
declares that she no longer wants to commit 
suicide.  
Clinical findings:  the patient presented with 
tachypnea at 41 cycles per minute, and 
desaturation at 68% on room air wit h cyanosis 
(Figure 1 ). Her heart rate was 110 beats per 
minute, with a blood pressure of 114/69 with no 
signs of shock or  cardiac failure. Pulmonary and 
cardiac auscultation was unremarkable. The 
patient  was conscient and reported dizziness and 
headaches.  
Timeline of current episode:  10th of November 
2021 at 1 a.m.: ingestion of 3 grams of dapsone; 
10th of November 2021 at 10 a.m.: admission of 
the patient with cyanosis desaturation and 
tachypnea, initiation of activated charcoal; 10th of 
November 2021 at 4 p.m.: results of 
methemoglobin levels received, diagnosis of methemoglobinemia made; 10th of November 
2021 at 5 p.m.: initiation of ascorbic acid; 12th of 
November 2021 at 11 a.m.: normal saturat ion, 
disappearance of cyanosis and tachypnea.  
Diagnostic assessment:  chest X -ray and 
electrocardiogram were performed with no 
abnormalities found. Electrolytes, renal  
function and the hemogram were normal ( Table 
1). Ar terial blood gas was realized while the 
patient received oxygen through a non -rebreather 
mask and showed hypocapnia resulting from 
hyperventilation, with hyperoxia. The 
methemoglobin assay wasn´t available in our 
hospital´s lab, and was carried out in another 
laboratory. It showed a methemoglobin 
percentage of 13.7%.  
Diagnosis:  the results were consistent with 
methemoglobinemia given the methemoglobin 
percentage of 13.7%, the saturation gap and the 
cyanosis.  
Therapeutic interventions:  our patien t receiv ed 
oxygen through a non -rebreather mask. 
Intravenous methylene blue wasn´t available. Our 
patient received 1 gram of ascorbic acid twice a 
day orally, and a loading dose of 50 grams of 
activated charcoal orally, followed by 25 grams 
every 6 hours orally.  
Follow -up and outcome of interventions:  we 
observed the disappearance of cyanosis and 
tachypnea, with normal saturation on room air 
after two days of treatment after progressive 
weaning from oxygen. No hemolytic anemia was 
observed during her stay in the in tensive care unit. 
After stabilization, the patient was transferred to 
the mental health unit for further management of 
her suicide attempt.  
Patient perspective:  “I hope there will be no 
complications. Overall, the treatment wasn´t 
painful given it consist ed mainly of oral intak e”. 
Informed consent:  the patient and her parents 
gave informed consent.

Discussion      
Methemoglobinemia is known to be an adverse 
effect of dapsone [ 1-3]. Its signs and symptoms are 
summarized in Table 2 . They include headaches, 
cyanosis, dizziness, tachypnea and low pulse 
oximeter readings [ 3]. An important gap between 
SpO2 and SaO2, known as saturation gap and 
refractory hypoxemia measured with SpO2 are 
additional clues supporting the diagnosis of 
methemoglobinemia [ 4]. The diagnosis is 
confirmed by arterial or venous blood gas with co -
oximetry, which determines the con centration or 
the percentage of methemoglobin.  
Management of methemoglobinemia relies on 
methylene blue infusion. Methylene blue is an 
exogenous electron donor which enhances the 
reduction of methemoglobinemia by the action of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleo tide phosphate 
hydrogen methemoglobin ( NADPH -MetHb) [ 4]. 
This treatment is contraindicated in the case of 
G6PD deficiency [ 5]. Ascorbic acid administration 
is considered as an alternative to methylene blue 
therapy, when the latter is contraindicated or not 
available [ 5]. Furthermore, dapsone is known to 
be adsorbed onto activated charcoal. In dapsone 
poisoning, multiple dose activated charcoal can be 
administered. It interrupts enteroen teric and 
hepatoenteric circulation, thus allowing secondary 
elimination of toxic agents [ 6]. 
In this case, the dapsone exposure, the patient ´s 
physical examination, the saturation gap and the 
increased methemoglobin percentage conf irmed 
the diagnosis of methemoglobinemia. We were 
limited in our approach to this case, given the 
unavailability of the methemoglobinemia level 
assay in our hospital´s laboratory and the 
methylene blue therapy. We initiated as fast as 
possible our treatmen t with the ascorbic acid and 
multiple dose activated charcoal treatment, thus 
improving our patient´s outcome and prognosis.  Conclusion      
Our patient with methemoglobinemia secondary 
to dapsone poisoning, had an excellent clinical 
outcome with disappearance of symptoms and 
signs of methemoglobinemia with the sole use of 
ascorbic acid and activated charcoal. This therapy 
can be used in the absence of methylene blue 
infusion or in the case of its contraindica tion.

A 36-year-old Northern European female was referred for a terti-
ary opinion regarding an unexplained anemia. She had a 6-month his-
tory of a symptomatic anemia, jaundiced sclerae, and dark urine. At the
age of 34 years, she had received dapsone therapy for a suspectedautoimmune disease. This had been discontinued because of anemia.There was no family history of anemia or other hematological abnor-
mality. Her blood count on presentation showed a macrocytic anemia
with a hemoglobin concentration (Hb) of 88 g/L and an MCV of 101 fL.The white cell count was 6.6 310
9/L with a normal differential count,
and the platelet count was 314 3109/L. The reticulocyte count was
elevated to 326 3109/L (12%). Bilirubin was 33 lmol/L and lactate
dehydrogenase was 372 iu/L. A direct antiglobulin test was negative.
Her blood film showed irregularly contracted cells, bite cells,
Howell –Jolly bodies and polychromasia (top Image). Protrusions from
red cells and dense areas within hemighosts (top right Image, arrow)
suggested the presence of Heinz bodies, this being confirmed on a
Heinz body preparation (bottom left Image). The findings supported adiagnosis of oxidative hemolysis but no clear underlying cause could be
identified. High performance liquid chromatography was performed
and showed a small peak eluting at 4.09 minutes in the hemoglobin Dwindow (bottom right Image). However, no variant hemoglobin was
detected by mass spectrometry and sequencing of the alpha and betaglobin genes did not reveal any mutation. Red cell glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase activity was elevated at 13.9 units/g of
hemoglobin, consistent with the degree of reticulocytosis.
At subsequent follow up the patient was noted to have dusky skin
discolouration centrally and peripherally. Blood gas analysis revealed a
methemoglobin level of 28%. The patient was admitted for furthermanagement. Methylene blue treatment was followed by a significant
fall of methemoglobin to under 5%, but the reduction was transient
and levels rose to over 20% within 24 hours. Red cell cytochrome b5
reductase activity was normal, excluding congenital methemoglobine-
mia. Acquired methemoglobinemia due to ongoing exposure to an
oxidant drug or chemical was suspected. A toxicology screen revealeda significant quantity of dapsone, a potent oxidant, in the patient ’s
urine and blood samples.
The patient was unable to explain the findings but after discussion
of these results, the methemoglobin level fell rapidly and Hb together
with markers of hemolysis progressively improved. Psychological
support was arranged.

ABSTRACT
Methemoglobinemia is a potentially fatal condition, mainly acquired after intoxication by certain drugs. To this date, only three cases 
associated with paracetamol have been reported. This case report describes a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney dis -
ease undergoing hemodialysis who was self-medicated with acetaminophen for seven days (at a daily dose of 3 g); the patient went to 
the hospital after noticing the appearance of a diffuse brownish skin tone, without other symptoms. Arterial blood analysis revealed an 
increase in methemoglobin levels, with biochemistry showing an increase in total bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase. Paracetamol 
was discontinued and on reassessment nine days after the onset of symptoms the patient had a clear improvement in her skin color, 
with normalization of methemoglobin levels.

INTRODUCTION
 Methemoglobin refers to hemoglobin with its iron in 
the oxidized state, which means it cannot reversibly bind 
oxygen. The normal range of methemoglobin is 0% - 1% 
of the total hemoglobin level1 with any increase above this 
value being called methemoglobinemia.
The vast majority of methemoglobinemias are acquired ,2 
usually resulting from excessive doses of drugs or other 
substances. Among these, the most frequently associated 
are dapsone, local anesthetics, sulfonamides, nitrites and 
aniline or its derivatives.
Paracetamol is currently the only aniline-derivate 
analgesic still marketed in Portugal. The most common 
consequences of paracetamol intoxication are well 
described including: gastrointestinal symptoms and hepatotoxicity; acute kidney injury; acute myocardial 
necrosis; pericarditis and hypoglycemia.3 Here we report 
a case of methemoglobinemia resulting from paracetamol 
ingestion, a rare but potentially serious complication of this 
drug.
CLINICAL CASE
Our patient was a 78-year-old  woman  with a history 
of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease on 
hemodialysis for 30 months as well as a mild cognitive 
impairment due to vascular dementia. She was chronically 
medicated with acetylsalicylic acid, calcium acetate/
magnesium carbonate, quetiapine and hydroxyzine.
Our patient came to the hospital due to the appearance RESUMO
A metemoglobinemia é uma condição potencialmente fatal, maioritariamente adquirida após intoxicação por determinados fármacos; 
até à data estão relatados apenas três casos associados à toma de paracetamol. Este caso clínico descreve uma doente com doença 
renal poliquística autossómica dominante, sob hemodiálise, que se automedicou com paracetamol durante sete dias (numa dose diária 
de 3 g); a doente recorreu ao hospital após ter notado o aparecimento de uma tonalidade cutânea difusamente acastanhada, sem 
outros sintomas. A análise de sangue arterial revelou aumento da metemoglobina, tendo a bioquímica apresentado um aumento da 
bilirrubina total e da aminotransferase da alanina. A toma de paracetamol foi suspensa, e na reavaliação nove dias após o início dos 
sintomas a doente apresentava uma clara melhoria da cor da pele, com normalização dos valores de metemoglobina.

other complaints (Fig. 1). She had been on hemodialysis the 
previous day, after which she took 1 g of oral paracetamol 
due to a slight elevation of her axillary temperature. She 
denied other symptoms, as well as intake of other drugs or 
substances apart from paracetamol 1 g three times daily for 
the previous seven days, due to osteoarticular complaints.
Upon physical examination she presented a diffuse 
brownish skin tone, with no other relevant alterations. 
Arterial blood gas analysis showed an increase in the 
percent of methemoglobin (3.3%). The complete blood 
count revealed an already known normochromic normocytic 
anemia (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL), without leukocytosis or 
other changes. The peripheral blood biochemistry was 
successively impossible to analyze due to repeated 
hemolysis of the four samples collected. The fifth sample 
allowed some results, among which were an increase in 
total bilirubin (1.62 mg/dL) and alanine aminotransferase 
(62 U/L).
The diagnosis of paracetamol-related methemoglo-
binemia was suspected, and the patient immediately 
stopped taking this drug, staying under observation. Two 
days later the skin color was bluish and the arterial blood 
gas analysis showed a discrete decrease in the percent 
of methemoglobin, which was now 2.9%. The analytical study revealed again an increase of bilirubin as well as of 
hepatic cytolysis enzymes. These findings supported the 
hypothesis of a paracetamol-related methemoglobinemia; 
the patient was discharged and advised to avoid this drug.
Nine days after the onset of symptoms the patient returned 
for reexamination. She reported a clear improvement of her 
skin color (Fig. 2). The analytical study did not show any 
significant changes; the arterial blood gas analysis showed 
a normalization of the percent of methemoglobin (0.6%).
DISCUSSION
Methemoglobin refers to hemoglobin with its iron in the 
ferric or oxidized state, which means that, contrary to the 
functional hemoglobin (with its iron in the ferrous or reduced 
state), it cannot reversibly bind oxygen. The normal range 
of methemoglobin is 0% - 1% of the total hemoglobin 
level,1 with any increase above this value being called 
methemoglobinemia.
Patients with acutely increased concentrations of 
methemoglobin have a functional anemia, as the amount 
of functional hemoglobin is less than the measured level 
of total hemoglobin. This results in tissue hypoxia by two 
mechanisms: first, methemoglobin is unable to bind and 
deliver oxygen; second, the remaining reduced hemoglobin 
has a higher affinity for oxygen, which means there is a left

shift in the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.4 
There are two types of methemoglobinemia: congenital, 
where the enzymatic reduction of methemoglobin back 
to functional hemoglobin is diminished and acquired, in 
which ingestion of specific drugs or oxidants cause an 
increase in the production of methemoglobin. The vast 
majority of methemoglobinemias are acquired,2 resulting 
from excessive doses of substances such as dapsone, 
local anesthetics, sulfonamides, nitrites and aniline or its 
derivatives.
In acquired methemoglobinemias, there is impairment 
in oxygen delivery to tissues that does not allow sufficient 
time for the development of compensatory mechanisms. 
Early manifestations of this condition include an alteration 
in skin color, which can appear pale, gray or blue; other 
symptoms such as lightheadedness, headache, tachycardia 
and dyspnea usually do not become apparent before 
methemoglobin levels of 20% to 30% of the total hemo-
globin. In the presence of more than 50% of methemoglobin, 
severe symptoms of hypoxia appear.2,5 Levels above 70% 
are usually fatal.
Treatment of patients with acquired methemoglobinemia 
will vary according to the percentage of methemoglobin 
present; if the level of methemoglobin is less than 20%, 
the patient is usually asymptomatic and the only therapy 
needed is discontinuation of the offending agent. On the 
other side, if the patient is symptomatic or in the event 
of a methemoglobin level of more than 20%, it may be 
necessary to manage the patient in an intensive care unit 
and use specific therapies such as methylene blue.6,7 
Aniline emerged as an analgesic substance in the late 
19th century,8 with acetanilide being the first aniline derivative 
with analgesic and antipyretic properties introduced in the 
market. Its high toxicity, mainly due to the production of methemoglobin, lead to the search and development of 
other less toxic aniline derivatives, such as phenacetine 
and paracetamol.9 Paracetamol is currently the only aniline 
derivative still marketed in Portugal.
In our patient, the only manifestation of the underlying 
condition was the discoloration of the skin. She did not 
present any other symptom, which was not surprising as 
she had only a slight elevation of the methemoglobin. Our 
patient also denied having ingested any kind of substances 
or drugs apart from paracetamol, which she had been taking 
on regular basis for the last seven days, about 3 g each day.
The most common consequences of paracetamol 
intoxication are well described, and include gastrointestinal 
symptoms and hepatotoxicity; acute kidney injury, myocardial 
necrosis, pericarditis and hypoglycemia have also been 
reported.3 Methemoglobinemia secondary to paracetamol is 
not common, with only a few cases reported in the literature. 
The first report dates to 1968, and describes a woman who 
developed methemoglobinemia after taking therapeutic 
doses of paracetamol for post-partum pain.10 Later, in 2000, 
a case of methemoglobinemia induced by combined use of 
sodium nitrate and paracetamol was described in Japan.11 
More recently, Kanji HD et al reported the occurrence of 
coma, metabolic acidosis, and methemoglobinemia in a 
patient with paracetamol toxicity.4 
The reason why paracetamol can lead to methe-
moglobinemia is not clear; however, four points in our 
case suggests that the culprit may be an active metabolite 
related to paracetamol (and hence to aniline): first, aniline 
related methemoglobinemia seems to be associated 
with an oxidant active metabolite, which appears to be 
phenylhydroxylamine12; second, it is known that aniline 
exposure can lead to hemolysis,13 and in our patient the 
blood samples for biochemical analysis were repeatedly 
hemolysed; third, phenylhydroxylamine intoxication is 
associated with hemolysis in individuals with G6PD 
deficiency14 and it has been reported that a large proportion 
of patients on hemodialysis show a functional G6PD 
deficiency15; and finally, our patient improved spontaneously 
after the suspension of paracetamol.

ABSTRACT
Background: Acetaminophen is a common pharmaceutical ingestion reported to US poison centers.
In overdose, toxic metabolites are known to cause hepato- and nephrotoxicity. While G6PD deficiencymay be a risk factor for methemoglobin production in the setting of acetaminophen overdose, it is
rarely reported in patients who do not have this condition.
Methods: We present two cases of methemoglobinemia following massive acetaminophen ingestion
with no known history of G6PD deficiency or other substances known to induce methemoglobinemia.
The two cases had peak methemoglobin measurements of 32% and 12% respectively, and both weretreated with methylene blue.
Discussion: A number of mechanisms may be involved in production of methemoglobin in the setting
of massive acetaminophen ingestion including NAPQI-induced oxidation, depletion of glutathionestores, and production of oxidant-metabolites including paraaminophenol. While it is unlikely that the
majority of acetaminophen overdoses result in any clinically significant methemoglobinemia, massive
acetaminophen overdose may be complicated by development of methemoglobinemia.
Conclusion: Physicians should be aware of the possibility that massive acetaminophen ingestion may
be complicated by methemoglobinemia in rare instances. Further studies should aim to characterizethe metabolic pathways leading to possible methemoglobinemia in humans after large acetamino-
phen ingestions.ARTICLE HISTORY

Background
Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most common pharmaceutical
overdose causing hospitalizations in the United States and a
common overdose worldwide. In therapeutic doses, the
majority of APAP is O-conjugated with glucuronide and sul-fate into nontoxic metabolites and a small percentage ( /C245%)
is oxidized via CYP2E1 to N-acetylbenzoquinoneimine(NAPQI) which is bound to glutathione (GSH) and detoxified
[1]. In overdose, NAPQI production overwhelms GSH supply,
binds to cellular proteins leading to a cascade of cellularevents that result in hepatic and renal toxicity [ 2–4].
Methemoglobinemia occurs when hemoglobin molecules
are oxidized, converting the ferrous (2 þ) iron into ferric (3 þ).
Methemoglobin delivers less oxygen to tissues thanhemoglobin and may lead to cellular dysfunction.Methemoglobinemia may be caused by oxidizing substancesincluding local anesthetics, antibiotics, aniline, and the his-
toric antipyretic-analgesics, acetanilide and phenacetin,
which are prodrugs of APAP [ 5]. APAP is an acetyl- and
hydroxyl- substituted aniline compound.
While G6PD deficiency is thought to put patients at risk
for methemoglobinemia and hemolysis following APAPingestion [ 6,7], methemoglobin production has rarely beendescribed in patients with no prior history of G6PD defi-
ciency [ 8–13]. Kanji et al. have reported a single case of
methemoglobinemia (9.4%) in association with massive acet-
aminophen ingestion [ 10]. Here we add two cases to the lit-
erature of methemoglobinemia after massive APAP ingestion
in patients with no known predisposing disease.
Case 1
A 54-year old man with cognitive impairment, diabetes, andhypertension presented to an emergency department for
evaluation of altered mental status. Initial evaluation noted
delirium with no other acute physical examination findings.
Laboratory studies were notable for metabolic acidosis with
an anion gap of 17. No acute finding were noted on CT and
MRI of the brain. The patient had intermittent hypotension,
remained delirious, and was admitted to the ICU. On hospital
day 2, laboratory studies were notable for acidemia (pH 7.2),
hyperlactatemia (14.5 mmol/L), and elevated aminotransfer-
ases (>200 U/L). Based on these laboratory abnormalities an
APAP concentration was sent and found to be 531 mcg/mL
despite none administered in the hospital. A discrepancy
between his pulse oximeter and arterial blood gas prompted

measurement of methemoglobin, which was 32%. The
patient was treated with 2 mg/kg of IV methylene blue. His
care facility reported no access to any methemoglobin-induc-
ing agents, no documented history of G6PD deficiency, and
no witnessed acetaminophen ingestion. The patient was
placed on CRRT by nephrology and received a bolus of N-
acetylcysteine (NAC) followed by a 9 hour delay until contin-
ued infusion due to a dosing error. Lab studies showed
improvement in methemoglobin (14.2%), acetaminophen
concentration (220 mcg/mL), and venous pH (7.29), however
he developed coagulopathy (INR 9.8), and aminotransferase
elevations peaking at AST/ALT 3487/2837 U/L. The patient
required increasing vasopressor support, and the familyelected to limit interventions. Thereafter he developed pulse-
less electrical activity and died. Postmortem blood and urine
were analyzed by GC/MS for over 250 common therapeutic
agents, revealing only his prescribed medications, metoprolol
and hydroxyzine.
Case 2
A 64-year old man with dementia, polysubstance abuse,depression, and hypertension presented to the emergency
department from a skilled nursing facility for altered mental
status. Initial evaluation was notable for dry mucus mem-
branes and delirium, but otherwise normal physical examin-
ation. He had a normal CT head with labs that were notable
for pH 7.25, anion gap of 28, acetaminophen concentration
of 730 mcg/mL, AST/ALT of 44/46 U/L, and methemoglobinconcentration rising from 4.9% to 12% over 8 hours. The
patient was treated with intravenous NAC and hemodialysis.
Given the severity of illness, he was also treated with 1 mg/
kg methylene blue. Over the next day the patient developed
respiratory failure and shock, and was treated with tracheal
intubation, antibiotics and vasopressors. The methemoglo-
binemia resolved within hours of treatment and the patient
never developed liver failure. He was not on any medications
known to induce methemoglobinemia, and had no known
history of G6PD deficiency. Over the next month the
patient ’s course was complicated by gastrointestinal hemor-
rhage, bowel perforation, and an exploratory laparotomy.
The patient was discharged from the hospital one month
after initial presentation.
Discussion
We present two cases of methemoglobinemia associated
with large APAP ingestions in the absence of known G6PD
deficiency. While methemoglobinemia in the setting of APAP
overdose is not well-described in humans [ 8–13], it is com-
mon in certain animals and similar physiology may provide a
scientific basis for this phenomenon in humans.
Supratherapeutic doses of APAP seem to ubiquitously
cause hepatotoxicity in mammals, with variable additional
toxic effects dependent on species-specific activating or
detoxifying enzymes [ 14–16]. In felines, methemoglobinemia
commonly results from acetaminophen ingestion for several
reasons. First, felines have limited glucuronidation capacity(<3% of APAP) [ 14,15,17] leading to proportionately more
APAP metabolized to the oxidant NAPQI. Second, felines
have decreased ability to reduce methemoglobin through
the enzyme methemoglobin reductase than a number of
other mammals [ 14]. Third, it has been proposed that the
most likely mechanism of hemotoxicity in felines occurs
through metabolism of APAP to the molecule para-amino-
phenol (PAP), and not NAPQI [ 18]. PAP is produced
by enzymatic deacetylation of APAP in erythrocytes and
is a close structural analogue of the methemoglobin
inducer aniline.
Human erythrocytes contain N-acetyltransferase [ 19],
which converts PAP to APAP, thus decreasing hemoglobin ’s
exposure to PAP. Additionally, humans glucuronidate the
majority of available APAP (50 –60%) leading to proportion-
ately less NAPQI production. Nonetheless, massive ingestions
may expose erythrocytes to increased oxidant stress from
increased exposure to APAP itself, excessive NAPQI produc-
tion, PAP generation, or another oxidant metabolite.
A minor mechanism of methemoglobin reduction in
mammals functions through nonenzymatic reduction with
GSH [ 20]. GSH has been shown to protect erythrocytes from
methemoglobin formation [ 21,22], and large APAP ingestions
are known to result in a GSH deficient state which may fur-
ther contribute to methemoglobinemia.
The historic antipyretic compounds acetanilide and
phenacetin are metabolized to methemoglobin-producing
metabolites aniline and ethoxyaniline, respectively. These
antipyretics are also metabolized to APAP and NAPQI, which
are structurally related to several molecules that produce
methemoglobinemia, most notably aniline.
It is unlikely that clinically significant methemoglobin pro-
duction occurs in most human APAP overdoses. However, it
is possible that in the setting of massive APAP ingestion as
presented in these two cases, the oxidants APAP, NAPQI, or
PAP oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin. In addition,
there are likely numerous enzymatic variants that predispose
some individuals to methemoglobinemia. Experimental ana-lysis of these metabolites and enzymatic pathways may eluci-
date the relationship between massive acetaminophen
overdose and methemoglobinemia.
Conclusion
Methemoglobinemia may rarely occur in large APAP inges-tion in humans. While the mechanistic details are speculative
at this point, further studies should characterize the meta-
bolic pathways leading to hemotoxicity.

A 25-year-old woman presented to the emergency department 
with a 1-day history of generalized weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, and skin discoloration. She had a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute 
and an oxygen saturation of 88% while breathing ambient air. The oxygen satura-tion value displayed on the pulse oximeter did not improve with the administration of supplemental oxygen. The patient appeared cyanotic (Panel A), and she had dark arterial and venous blood (Panel B, smaller tube and larger tube, respectively). Measurements of arterial blood gases included a partial pressure of arterial oxygen of 120 mm Hg and a calculated oxygen saturation of 100%; however, when mea-sured by CO-oximetry, the oxygen saturation was 67%. The percentage of methe-moglobin was 44%. She was treated with intravenous methylene blue and had considerable improvement in her breathing and reduction in skin discoloration. She reported having used large amounts of topical benzocaine the night before for a toothache. Methemoglobinemia can occur after exposure to a number of medica-tions, including topical anesthetic agents such as benzocaine, through metabolic pathways that appear to vary from person to person, which may account for the unpredictability of this complication. The patient had complete resolution of her symptoms, and she was referred for outpatient dental follow-up.

Background  Methemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition caused by oxidation of 
ferrous hemoglobin (Fe2+) to the ferric (Fe3+) state, making it incapable of binding oxygen and resulting in cyanosis 
and tissue ischemia.
Case presentation  This case presentation describes a 1-year-old boy who developed sudden cyanosis and reduced 
consciousness disorder. An initial assessment showed decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2 85%) despite oxygen 
therapy, while point-of-care venous blood gas (VBG) analysis assessed high rates of MetHb (72.7%). Methylene blue 
and ascorbic acid were administered, resulting in in rapid clinical recovery and normalized VBG test results. The trigger 
for this condition was not identified, however the most likely cause of poisoning was attributed to food oxidants.
Conclusion  Starting from the description of a clinical case, this paper discusses the causes and mechanisms of 
possible poisoning and reviews recent guidelines for methemoglobinemia management.

no parental consanguinity. He had a flat angioma on the 
left hemisphere, which was under follow-up. The mother 
reported that before the symptoms started, the child had 
been playing at home in a well-ventilated room. He had 
no known allergies and was not taking any medications. 
There were no recent symptoms such as cough, fever, or 
other concerns. His last meal, consumed about one hour 
before the event, consisted of beef meat and Swiss chard. 
No other person in the family had consumed the same 
foods.
Upon obtaining an arterial blood sample, the color of 
the blood was noted to be dark brown. Venous blood 
gas analysis demonstrated abnormal findings including 
markedly decreased PO2 (9 mmHg), reduced oxygen sat -
uration (SO2 23.9%), elevated lactate levels (4.5 mmol/L), 
and a significantly elevated methemoglobin (MetHb) 
concentration (72.7%). pH was 7.33 and PCO2 43 mmHg. 
The patient’s hemoglobin level was 11.8  g/dL, and the 
glucose level was 121 mg/dL. Chest X-ray was unremark -
able. Approximately 15  min after the patient’s arrival, 
his clinical condition rapidly deteriorated. He became 
drowsy and experienced seizures, with oxygen saturation 
dropping as low as 70%.
At this point the patient received intravenous methy -
lene blue (MB) at a dose of 2  mg/kg over 5  min, which 
was repeated after 15  min. This intervention led to a 
rapid improvement in the patient’s clinical status, includ -
ing normalization of consciousness, skin color, and oxy -
gen saturation levels. The patient was then transferred to 
the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring. 
A blood gas analysis performed 3 h later demonstrated a 
significant reduction in MetHb levels to 2.9%. Through -
out the observation period, the child’s overall condition 
remained consistently good. Treatment was continued 
with the administration of ascorbic acid (500  mg given 
twice daily for a total of 16 doses). The following day, 
MetHb levels had returned to the normal range at 1% 
and remained stable during continued observation. 
Subsequent tests indicated normal renal and hepatic 
parameters [S-urea 25 (20–45) mg/dl, S-creatinine 0.34 
(0.20–1.3) mg/dl, bilirubin total 0.2 (0.2–1.2) mg/dL and 
direct 0.1 (0–0.4) mg/dL; alanine transaminase 34 (5–40) 
units/L; aspartate transaminase 55 (5–40) units/L]. 
Inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and 
procalcitonin, were negative. The microbiological exami -
nations of stool specimens (stool culture, Enterobacteria, 
Enterovirus, Adenovirus, Rotavirus) resulted in negative 
outcomes. Additionally, the patient’s glucose-6-phos -
phate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity was within the 
normal reference range (12.9 (> 9.4) U/gr Hb) and anal -
ysis of hemoglobin variants with HPLC method did not 
reveal any abnormalities.
Given the normal basal levels of MetHb, clinicians 
decided not to pursue further genetic investigations and instead focused on acquired causes of MetHb. Since the 
child had not taken any medications or been exposed to 
any new substances, there was suspicion of food poison -
ing. The case was reported to public health authorities, 
who conducted a thorough analysis on the meat that the 
child had for lunch; however, they found no evidence 
of contamination. Unfortunately, it was not possible to 
investigate the vegetables as they had all been consumed.
Discussion and conclusions
Pathophysiology
Methemoglobinemia is an uncommon but potentially 
life-threatening condition caused by the oxidation of 
the iron in hemoglobin, converting it from the normal 
ferrous (Fe2+) state to the ferric (Fe3+) state [ 2]. This 
altered form of hemoglobin, known as methemoglobin 
(MetHb), is incapable of effectively transporting and 
releasing oxygen to the body’s tissues. As a result, the 
oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve shifts to the left, 
leading to functional anemia and reduced oxygen deliv -
ery. Normally, the cytochrome b5 reductase (CytB5) 
enzyme pathway maintains a low basal level of MetHb, 
typically around 1.0-1.5% [ 3]. However, in certain situa -
tions, such as during an oxidant challenge, a secondary 
pathway involving glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G6PD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) 
can become more prominent in helping to manage ele -
vated MetHb levels (Fig.  1) [4, 5].
Methemoglobinemia can be either inherited or 
acquired. The inherited, form is attributed to mutations 
in the CYB5R3 gene, which encodes the CytB5 enzyme. 
This genetic condition presents in two subtypes: type 
I, characterized by an unstable enzyme localized to red 
blood cells, leading to methemoglobin levels exceeding 
25% and symptoms such as cyanosis, headache, fatigue, 
and dyspnea; and type II, caused by variants that dimin -
ish enzyme expression or activity across all tissues, 
resulting in methemoglobin levels ranging from 8 to 40% 
and severe neurological manifestations. The distinction 
between type I and II methemoglobinemia stems from 
the differential expression of CYB5R isoforms in red 
blood cells compared to other cell types [ 6]. In addition 
to the autosomal recessive forms of methemoglobinemia, 
a rare group of hemoglobin variants known as M group 
variants (HbM) can arise from autosomal dominant 
mutations in the genes encoding the globin chains. These 
HbM variants are characterized by structural abnormali -
ties that lead to heme iron auto-oxidation and cyanosis, 
often without manifesting other significant symptoms 
[7]. To date 13 distinct HbM variants have been identi -
fied, with some named after the geographic locations in 
which they were first discovered. HbM variants affecting 
the alpha-globin chain typically cause cyanosis evident at 
birth, while those involving the beta-globin chain become

apparent later as fetal hemoglobin is replaced by the 
adult form [ 8].
Acquired MetHb, on the other hand, is caused by the 
consumption of certain drugs or exposure to toxins 
that hasten the oxidation of hemoglobin, resulting in 
a temporary increase in MetHb levels. Some common 
agents associated with acquired MetHb include: nitrites, 
such as those found in certain medications (e.g., ben -
zocaine, dapsone, nitrates), chemicals such as aniline 
dyes and aromatic compounds, certain antibiotics (e.g., sulfonamides), and ingesting contaminated well water 
and food containing nitrate [ 9, 10] (Table  1).
In the presented case, the patient’s history did not 
indicate any genetic conditions, and baseline MetHb 
levels were normal. As such, the clinicians focused their 
investigations on potential foodborne poisoning. Given 
that tests on the consumed meat were unremarkable, 
the clinicians inferred that the Swiss chard was the likely 
source of the oxidative insult. This hypothesis aligns 
with findings from a recent systematic review on food-
induced MetHb, which identified nitrites and nitrates as Table 1  Substances that can cause MetHb [ 9, 11]

Fig. 1  Enzymes involved in methemoglobin (MetHb) homeostasis. The primary process for reducing MetHb is mediated by cytochrome b5-methe -
moglobin reductase (CytB5), which utilizes the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) formed during glycolysis to reduce met -
hemoglobin back to functional hemoglobin. Additionally, a smaller contribution is made by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dependent 
methemoglobin (NADPH-MetHb) reductase. Under normal physiologic circumstances, NADPH-MetHb reductase contributes very little to the reduction 
of methemoglobin, but under oxidative stress, the function of this alternative reduction pathway can be enhanced by the presence of exogenous elec -
tron shuttle, such as methylene blue, which allows NADPH to reduce methemoglobin

the primary oxidizing agents implicated [ 12]. The review 
further noted that the most common scenarios for food-
related methemoglobinemia involve children consuming 
improperly stored vegetables (30%), accidental ingestions 
(27%), and errors during meat curing processes (27%) 
[12].
Nitrates and nitrites play a central role in the develop -
ment of methemoglobinemia [ 13]. Nitrates are relatively 
less harmful than nitrites, but they can be transformed 
into nitrites through various processes, often due to 
improper storage or cooking of certain vegetables like 
spinach, beets, and carrots [ 14]. Nitrites are commonly 
used in the food industry to maintain the pinking of meat 
or in high doses to preserve meat and kill bacteria [ 15]. 
A target concentration of nitrate nitrogen for food of less 
than 100 ppm is desirable for infants, and some com -
mercially prepared infant food vegetables are monitored 
voluntarily by manufacturers for nitrate content [ 16]. 
Children are particularly vulnerable to methemoglobin -
emia related to nitrites and nitrates. They have lower 
stomach acid production, leading to a greater presence of 
nitrate-reducing bacteria in their gut flora. Additionally, 
the methemoglobin reductase system, which helps man -
age elevated methemoglobin levels, only fully matures 
around six months of age. This combination of increased 
nitrite/nitrate exposure and immature reductase system 
puts young children at higher risk for developing methe -
moglobinemia from food sources [ 12, 17].
Clinical features and diagnostic approach
To diagnose this disease and distinguish between heredi -
tary and acquired forms, it is crucial to obtain a detailed 
clinical and family history, assess for consanguinity, 
and review environmental and drug exposures. For 
acquired forms, the cyanosis is typically of acute onset, 
so promptly investigating a history of drug or toxin expo -
sure is important. In contrast, a longstanding family 
history of cyanosis, dusky-coloured skin, or blue sclera 
would suggest congenital forms [ 8].
The clinical manifestations of acute acquired MethHb 
are contingent on the percentage of methemoglobin satu -
ration. Saturation levels below 10% typically do not cause 
symptoms, while levels between 10% and 25% result in 
cyanosis. As MethHb levels increase, individuals may 
experience symptoms such as headache, fatigue, dizzi -
ness nd shortness of breath at levels ranging from 35 to 
40% [ 18]. Levels reaching 60% can lead to arrhythmias, 
seizures, lethargy, and stupor. When surpassing 70%, it 
may cause vascular collapse and death [ 19, 20].
Patients who experience a sudden onset of cyanosis 
and hypoxia that does not improve despite 100% oxygen 
therapy, as indicated by arterial blood gas results and the 
distinct dark red/chocolate brown color of the arterial 
blood during phlebotomy, may indicate an increase in MetHb [ 21]. Confirming the diagnosis involves measur -
ing MetHb levels, obtaining positive co-oximetry results, 
and identifying an oxygen saturation gap greater than 5% 
between arterial blood gas oxygen saturation and pulse 
oximeter reading (SpO2-SaO2) [ 22].
It is crucial to consider the hemoglobin levels of the 
patient and compute methemoglobin levels using the 
formula Hemoglobin in grams per deciliter multiplied 
by MetHb percentage (g/dL x MetHb%). This method 
will yield a more precise measurement of MetHb level in 
grams per deciliter, enhancing accuracy when assessing 
residual functional hemoglobin levels [ 23]. In our case 
report the patient had only 3.2 gr/dl of functional hemo -
globin left as the Hb level was 11.4 gr/dl, and MetHb 
saturation was 72.7%. It is noteworthy that despite cya -
nosis being commonly associated with MetHb, a system -
atic review has revealed that cyanosis and hypoxemia are 
not always present in acquired MetHb cases. This under -
scores the significance of using co-oximetry as a diagnos -
tic tool, which utilizes at least four light wavelengths to 
measure various forms of hemoglobin including oxyhe -
moglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, CO-Hb, and Met-Hb [ 23, 
24]. Alternative technologies, such as optoacoustic or 
spectral sensors, have been proposed to detect dysfunc -
tional hemaglobin types in the bloodstream. Similarly, 
non-invasive methods based on in silico models have 
been explored. These alternative options may offer sup -
plementary support for the clinical management of met -
hemoglobinemia going forward [ 25].
Key diagnostic tests in the evaluation of suspected con -
genital methemoglobinemia include: assessing MetHb 
levels, measuring CYB5R enzyme activity, and con -
ducting genetic testing. In individuals with congenital 
CYB5R3 deficiency, the activity of the CYB5R enzyme 
is typically reduced to less than 20% of the normal level. 
Electrophoresis can identify HbM variants caused by 
mutations in globin genes and DNA sequencing of the 
CYB5R3 gene can confirm the diagnosis. Emerging next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies facilitate the 
detection and characterization of significant genetic vari -
ants in patients with rare erythrocyte disorders such as 
methemoglobinemia, thereby expediting the differential 
diagnosis [ 26].
Therapy
The management of methemoglobinemia in infants and 
children is guided by multiple considerations, such as 
symptoms, the overall percentage of methemoglobin, 
the underlying cause of the methemoglobinemia, and the 
patient’s age. Asymptomatic individuals with methemo -
globin levels below 20% typically do not necessitate any 
specific intervention beyond the avoidance of oxidizing 
agents. For acquired methemoglobinemia, treatment is 
recommended at levels of 20% in symptomatic patients 
Page 5 of 6
Pjetraj et al. Italian Journal of Pediatrics            (2025) 51:53 
and 30% in asymptomatic patients. Patients with heredi -
tary methemoglobinemia can tolerate higher MetHb lev -
els, with some remaining asymptomatic up to 30–40% 
[8].
Prompt initiation of therapy involves halting exposure 
to the triggering oxidant stressor and providing high-
flow oxygen. Methylene blue (MB) is the most effec -
tive antidote, as it stimulates NADPH MetHb reductase 
(Fig.  1) [5]. The suggested administration is 1 to 2 mg/kg 
via intravenous infusion of a 1% solution over a span of 
5 min. If required this dosage can be repeated within an 
hour [ 27, 28]. It should be pointed out that the admin -
istration of MB is controversial in patients with known 
G6PD deficiency, due to the risk of hemolytic anemia 
[29, 30]. MB is an oxidizing agent, while its metabolic 
product, leukomethylene blue, is a reducing agent. Large 
doses of MB can lead to higher levels of the oxidizing 
agent itself rather than the reducing metabolite, result -
ing in hemolysis. Moreover in G6PD deficiency, the lack 
of sufficient NADPH production prevents the reduction 
of MB to the less oxidizing leukomethylene blue, conse -
quently, MB therapy may be ineffective in G6PD-deficient 
patients [ 5]. That is why in the latest recommendations 
for diagnosis and treatment of MetHb it is empha -
sised that patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency 
before receiving MB treatment, and in case of emergency 
include, the patient’s family history of G6PD deficiency 
should be checked before administering MB [ 8]. In this 
case options include administering MB in a low dose 
combined with ascorbic acid, or not using it at all and 
providing ascorbic acid only [ 31]. Ascorbic acid antioxi -
dant capacity enables direct reduction of MetHb levels, 
however the process is slow and often requires multiple 
doses over 24 h. It is the preferred treatment when MB is 
unavailable or in cases of MetHb with G6PD deficiency. 
Dosing in children ranges from 0.5  g every 12  h for 16 
doses to 1  g every 4  h for 8 doses. In case of failure of 
the listed treatments, other treatment options include 
exchange transfusion and hyperbaric oxygen therapy [ 4].
In McNulty’s systematic review on food-induced 
metaemoglobinemia most cases resulted in survival (35 
deaths out of 568 cases reported), even when experienc -
ing severe methemoglobin levels reaching up to 89%, 
as long as MB was promptly administered. None of the 
fatalities had received MB [ 12]. There were no deaths 
reported from cases of favism crisis which, in general, 
had lower methemoglobin fractions (maximum 15.8%). 
This emphasizes the significance of promptly identifying 
the toxidrome and initiating treatment with antidotes.
Due to the infrequency of this condition, the existing 
literature mainly comprises collections of case studies. 
A recent study conducted at five Italian pediatric emer -
gency departments between 2007 and 2010 reported 
nineteen instances of acquired MetHb. The median age was 8.23 months, with a median time of 6 h from trigger 
to symptom onset. Improper food preservation, particu -
larly vegetable broth, was identified as the primary source 
of poisoning in most cases. MB treatment was adminis -
tered to 14 patients (73.7%), all of whom survived [ 32].
Another similar case series formulated by a Canadian 
pediatric emergency department involved 10 patients 
with acquired MetHb. Half of them were affected by 
hematologic malignancies, so the trigger of poisoning 
was easily identified as pharmacological (dapsone and 
rasburicase). The other half presented a previously undi -
agnosed G6PD deficiency and concomitant explosion to 
fava beans and topical menthol. Five of the patients were 
treated with packed red blood cell transfusion, two of 
them were given MB (MetHb saturation of 19% and 22%), 
one was treated with ascorbic acid and the last received 
supportive therapy with fluids and oxygen [ 33].
This case report highlights the importance of under -
standing and properly managing MetHb. High-fidelity 
simulation, as demonstrated by Alagha et al., can be a 
valuable tool for teaching this topic. Their simulation 
allowed participants to evaluate and treat MetHb in a 
safe, controlled setting. It was followed by a debriefing 
and discussion to review aspects of patient care, includ -
ing medical knowledge, communication, and practice-
based learning. The educational content and effectiveness 
were evaluated through feedback and a post-simulation 
survey. The survey showed that after the simulatiothin, 
92% of emergency medicine residents felt confident in 
recognizing and treating MetHb, compared to 62.5% 
before. Overall, the results indicate that simulation-based 
training can improve recognition and management of 
MetHb [ 34].
In conclusion, acquired MetHb in the pediatric emer -
gency department is an uncommon occurrence, but it 
should be considered when a patient presents with cya -
nosis, persistent hypoxia, “cyanosis-saturation gap, ” and 
dark brown blood. Familiarity with this toxidrome and 
its clinical manifestations, despite its rarity, enables cli -
nicians to initiate timely and suitable antidote therapy 
which can often be life-saving.

SuMMARY – The objective of this case report is to present a patient with acquired methemoglo-
binemia due to poisoning of an unknown cause. A 55-year-old man was brought to the emergency 
department, university hospital Center Zagreb, with an unwell appearance, cyanotic, restless, and 
presented with a  quantitative consciousness  disorder. An initial assessment showed decreased oxygen 
saturation (Spo2 85 [%]), while point-of-care arterial blood gas (Abg) analysis assessed normal par-
tial pressure of oxygen (po2). Severe lactic acidosis with a compensatory drop in partial pressure of 
carbon dioxide (pC o2) and high rates of methemoglobin were found. Supportive oxygen therapy 
and crystalloid solutions were administered, which resulted in rapid clinical recovery within 40 minutes of the initial assessment. Clinical recovery was accompanied by normalized Abg test results taken seri-ally. typical antidotes, methylene blue and vitamin C, were not administered due to rapid clinical im-
provement. Methemoglobinemia can be congenital (hereditary) or acquired (toxic). both conditions are rarely seen in emergency departments, nevertheless, they should be approached properly since methe-moglobinemia can be a severe, and fatal, condition. Methemoglobinemia symptoms are the results of 
inadequate oxygen transport. The diagnosis was confirmed by co-oximetry, while three clinical entities 
suspected methemoglobinemia: refractory hypoxia, “cyanosis-saturation gap“ and dark brown blood. 
This paper reports our patient’s clinical presentation, discusses the causes and mechanisms of possible 
poisoning, and reviews recent guidelines for methemoglobinemia management.
Key words: lactic acidosis, methemoglobinemia, poisoning

Methaemoglobinaemia is not the first among dif-
ferential diagnoses that crosses a clinician’s mind when 
assessing a cyanotic and hypoxemic patient. in this case 
report, we will present a patient with acquired methe-
moglobinemia, explain the pathophysiology of methe-
moglobinemia and the diagnostic process, together with 
specific and supportive treatment for such patients.
Case report
A 55-year-old man was brought to the emergency 
department of the university hospital Center Zagreb. he was delirious, with an altered state of conscious-
ness (glasgow Coma Scale =11) and presented with pronounced grey skin and a disheveled appearance. 
According to the physician from the emergency Med-
ical Service (e MS), the patient was found in this con-
dition at a tram station, and passers-by called an am-bulance. while being transported, he lost conscious-
ness at times, urinated, and had diarrhea on several occasions. d uring the initial assessment in the emer-
gency room, it was not possible to obtain a medical 
history data from the patient due to his altered mental 
status. The patient maintained normal blood pressure (RR 134/88 mmhg) and heart rate (c/p 88/min) but was tachypneic, hypoxic (Spo2 90 [%]), and hypo-
thermic ( t 34.5 [°C]). The examination was difficult 
due to the patient’s extreme restlessness and uncoop-
erativeness. except for cold and pale-grey skin, no spe-cific pathological signs were observed. human fixa-

in total), and iv diazepam infusion (1 ampoule in 500ml saline) were administered, and a urinary cath-eter was inserted. upon obtaining an arterial blood specimen, a dark brown blood color was noticed (Fig-ure 1). An arterial blood gas (Abg) analysis at room air (see table 1) showed marked acidemia (ph 7.04), 
normal partial pressure of oxygen (po2 12.2 [kp a]), 
reduced oxygen saturation (Spo2 85 [%]), reduced partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC o2 3.1 [kp a]) 
and bicarbonate ion (hC o3- 5.2 [mmol/l]), excess 
bases (be ecf -23.0 [mmol/l]) and markedly elevated lactates (l ac> 20 [mmol/l]. o xygen was delivered via 
an oxygen mask with a flow of 15 l/min. in addition, 75 ml of bicarbonate ion in 500 ml of 5% glucose solution and 1000 ml of heated crystalloid solution (plasmal yte) were administered. Reassessment of vi-
tal signs indicated hypotension (RR 88/61 mmhg), 
tachycardia (c/p 115/min) and reduced oxygen satura-
tion (Spo2 90 [%]), despite the maximal oxygen flows 
via a non-rebreather mask. The eC g showed atrial fi-
brillation, 150 beats/min, normal electrical axis and 
diffuse St -segment displacement. Mild macrocytic 
anemia and leukocytosis (lkc=17.6 [x10
9/l]), hypo-
kalemia (K=3.0 [mmol/l]), mildly elevated creatine kinase (CK=225 [u/l] and the presence of ethanol in the blood (Al C=0.6 [g/l]) were found, while other 
parameters were within the limit of physiological in-
tervals, including cardioselective enzymes. A toxicolo-
gy screen determined only the presence of nicotine and lidocaine (due to urinary catheter placement), but 
not all psychoactive substances were included in the 
analysis. The Abg test was repeated ( table 2) 40 min-
utes after the initial monitoring. Severe acidosis with increased anion gap (ph 7.14) was still present, now with elevated partial oxygen pressure (po2 36.6 [kp a]), 
normal oxygen saturation (Spo2 99.8 [%]) and nor-mal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC o2 4.1 
[kpa]). l actate values were still increased (l ac 16.7 
[mmol/l]), as well as excess bases (be ecf -18.4 [mmol/l]) and bicarbonate ion   (hC o3- 9.8 
[mmol/l]), but with a normalization tendency com-pared to the initial values. An elevated percentage of methemoglobin (Meth b 36.4 [%]) was observed. 
during the observation of our patient in the emer-
gency unit, ph and lactate values normalized (ph 7.42, l ac 1.3 [mmol/l]), and his mental status im-
proved. in an interview with the patient, we found out that he drank 0.5l of water from a hydrant at the main station, after which he fell ill. we cannot claim with 
certainty that water from a hydrant was the definite cause of poisoning. we later discovered that he was 
homeless with no regular income and did not suffer from chronic diseases and did not take chronic drug therapy. The patient was admitted to the post-inten-
sive care unit at the department of internal Medicine, 
university hospital Center Zagreb. Serial monitoring 
of the patient’s acid-base status was continued. A de-
crease in the percentage of methemoglobin, normal-Table 1. Initial ABG on room air - results.

given therapy were recorded. The paroxysm of atrial fibrillation spontaneously converted to a sinus rhythm 
that was later maintained permanently. d uring hospi-
talization, the patient was briefly sub febrile on several occasions. The patient had no signs of infection, no in-
crease in inflammatory parameters was observed, so there was no indication for antibiotic therapy. due to 
the favorable clinical course with the use of oxygen therapy and intravenous replacement of crystalloid so-lutions, there was no need to use antidotes - methylene 
blue and vitamin C. The social service was contacted. 
The patient recovered fully and was discharged from the hospital five days after admission.
Discussion
Methaemoglobinaemia is a rare disorder character-
ized by the oxidation of divalent iron to the trivalent 
form (from ferrous to ferric form) in the hemoglobin 
molecule. o xygen can bind to hemoglobin only in di-
valent (ferrous) form, and as a result of binding, oxygen is temporarily oxidized to ferric form. various sub-
stances, which will be listed later, can cause hemoglo-bin to remain permanently in a ferric form and thus no 
longer be able to bind oxygen. Therefore, the symp-
toms of methemoglobinemia are a direct consequence 
of inadequate oxygen transport. The specific mecha-
nism is an allosteric change in the hemoglobin mole-
cule. in addition, due to further changes in the oxy-
gen–hemoglobin dissociation curve (a change in oxy-
gen dissociation to the left), there is reduced periph-
eral oxygen release
1, hypoxia, and functional anemia2 
with no decrease in hemoglobin level. Methaemoglo-
binaemia can occur as a result of a congenital defect or 
as an acquired disorder. Acquired disorders are more 
common and occur as a result of exposure to substanc-
es that directly or indirectly oxidize hemoglobin. Con-
genital causes of methemoglobinemia arise from an autosomal recessive variant of the CYb5R3 gene or an 
autosomal dominant variation of genes encoding a 
globin molecule known as h bM disease. hereditary 
methemoglobinemia, as a consequence of mutations in the CYb5R3 gene, leads to n Adh-cytochrome-re-
ductase deficiency, with up to 80 different variants of 
this disorder known today.
3,4 Autosomal dominant 
disease involving various genes encoding alpha-globin, 
beta-globin, and gamma-globin leads to the formation of M-hemoglobin, in which structural abnormalities of globin lead to auto-oxidation of iron, and thus to 
the occurrence of methemoglobinemia. p atients suf-
fering from this disease are cyanotic but usually as-
ymptomatic
5. Acquired methemoglobinemia results 
from drug intake or exposure to toxins lead to acceler-ated oxidation of hemoglobin from ferrous to ferric form.
6 table 3 lists the most common drugs that can 
lead to the development of methemoglobinemia.
The clinical presentation of methemoglobinemia is 
various and depends on the percentage of methemo-globin, a patient’s usual hemoglobin level, and cardio-Table 2. ABG test results on a non-rebreather mask with a 15L/min flow.

globin is below 25%. p atients with levels between 3 
and 15% are usually asymptomatic, and cyanosis is 
rare. p atients with methemoglobin levels between 20-
30% are always symptomatic, with mild symptoms 
such as fatigue, tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, anxi-ety, dizziness, qualitative disturbance of consciousness, nausea, and vomiting. At levels above 40%, life-threat-ening and serious symptoms occur, such as epileptic 
seizures, coma, arrhythmias, elevated lactate levels, and 
death. The final diagnosis is made using co-oximetry, but clinical suspicion itself can be made based on the following three entities:
7
•	Refractory hypoxia: methemoglobinemia can 
typically be suspected in a patient with oxygen 
saturation between 82-86%, who is at high oxy-
gen flows (Fio2 100%), and no other explana-
tion for hypoxia
•	“Cyanosis-saturation gap”: methemoglobinemia 
leads to the development of central cyanosis (at-
tention to the color of the tongue). o xygen satu-
ration of 80-90% usually does not lead to cyano-sis, so patients with 80-90% saturation who 
present with central cyanosis are clinically suspi-cious of methemoglobinemia
•	brown blood color: methemoglobinemia causes a change of blood color to chocolate-like. Also, if we put a patient’s blood on white gauze, the 
blood will remain brown when dry, unlike de-
oxygenated blood, which will absorb oxygen in 
the air and turn red again
As noted, the diagnosis of methemoglobinemia 
was made based on co-oximetry. unlike standard pulse oximeters that measure light absorption at two wave-
lengths, co-oximetry measures light absorption at four wavelengths: 600nm (carboxyhemoglobin), 631nm 
(methemoglobin), 660nm (deoxyhemoglobin), and 
940 nm. based on this analysis, multiple disorders can 
be diagnosed - both carboxyhaemoglobinaemia and 
methemoglobinemia.
8 in addition to this formal test, 
simple tests can be used for rough assessment, which, 
based on the color of the blood on a white paper, pro-vide an estimate of the level of methemoglobinemia.
9 
Figure 2 shows the blood color shades scale of brown, which could be helpful in everyday clinical work.
9 Fi-
nally, calculation of the so-called “saturation gap” (the 
difference between the measured saturation and that 
measured with a pulse oximeter), could also be useful. 
A difference of more than 5% may raise a suspicion of methemoglobinemia.
treatment of methemoglobinemia is primarily 
based on supportive care and discontinuation of the 
drug or substance use that leads to this condition. de-finitive treatment involves the reduction of methemo-
globin to a non-oxidized state using methylene blue, which is the drug of choice for the treatment of met-
hemoglobinemia. Methylene blue, along with nicotin-
amide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (n Adph), is 
a co-factor of the enzyme nAdph-methemoglobin 
reductase. it works by accepting an electron from 
nAdph and in this form reduces trivalent iron from 
ferric form to ferrous form.
10 The use of methylene 
blue is indicated in symptomatic methemoglobinemia regardless of methemoglobin level, and in cases where 
the methemoglobin level is above 30%. The drug is 
contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency, and caution is re-
quired in patients at risk of developing serotonin syn-
drome. Methylene blue is a monoamine oxidase 
(MA o) inhibitor and can lead to the development of 
serotonin syndrome in interaction with other drugs. The drug dose is 1-2 mg/kg iv over five minutes, while 
the clinical effect is visible within a few minutes. Cya-nosis resolves within one hour after application. when 
applying the drug, there may be a “drop” in oxygen saturation, because methylene blue turns the blood blue, and it falsely reduces the saturation value mea-

I. Ivek et al. MethemoglobinemiaActa Clin Croat, Vol. 61, (Suppl. 1) 2022 97may recur within 12 hours after drug administration, 
after which continuous infusion of methylene blue 
may be considered1,11 in patients with g6pd defi-
ciency, treatment is more complex. it is important to 
note that this deficit occurs in African Americans but 
also presents in people from the Mediterranean re-
gion.12 These patients lack n Adph, due to g6pd 
deficiency, and therefore methylene blue either has no effect at all, or has some effect, but the further applica-
tion of already low nAdph levels will lead to lower 
glutathione levels, leading to hemolysis. in these pa-tients, treatment with high doses of vitamin C (1.5-3g 
iv every six hours) may be attempted. in addition, ri-boflavin (vitamin b2), which acts as an electron accep-
tor, can be added to the therapy. The use of methylene 
blue may also be considered, but with caution. if all of 
the treatment modalities listed fail, complete erythro-cyte transfusion and hyperbaric chamber transplanta-tion may be considered. Methylene blue can be re-dosed if needed. Caution should be exercised when the 
drug level comes close to 7ml/kg as there is a risk of 
drug toxicity.
13 At toxic or subtoxic doses, methylene 
blue may worsen methemoglobinemia and hemolysis, 
which occurs because of the bioaccumulation of meth-
ylene blue, leading to a reversal of the reductive action. Side effects of methylene blue are as follows: systemic 
and/or pulmonary hypertension (via a reaction that 
prevents nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation), motor restlessness, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and 
anaphylaxis.
Conclusion
Methaemoglobinaemia is a rare disorder character-
ized by elevated levels of methemoglobin, a hemoglo-bin molecule that contains an oxidized form of iron 
that cannot bind oxygen and results in an inadequate oxygen supply to tissues. There are two forms of the 
disease - genetic and acquired methemoglobinemia. 
genetic methemoglobinemia is a chronic disease that 
leads to numerous morbidities, and patients are mostly 
characterized by cyanosis without associated other symptoms. Acquired methemoglobinemia, on the oth-
er hand, is an acute condition that is most often the 
result of poisoning by certain drugs and compounds, 
which can be fatal. The severity of symptoms depends 
on the percentage of methemoglobin in the blood, and 
clinical presentation varies from fatigue, anxiety, dizzi-ness, and cyanosis, to qualitative disorders of con-
sciousness, epileptic seizures, arrhythmia, and coma. 
unexplained symptoms of refractory hypoxia, cyano-
sis-saturation gap, and chocolate-colored blood may 
raise suspicion of methemoglobinemia, but the defini-
tive diagnosis is made using co-oximetry and detecting 
methemoglobin levels in the blood. treatment of met-
hemoglobinemia is based on supportive care and dis-continuation of the drug or substance that led to this 
condition. despite being a rare condition, acquired 
methemoglobinemia can be a life-threatening condi-
tion and emergency services should be provided with 
antidotes - methylene blue and vitamin C.

WHATISMETHEMOGLOBINEMIA?Methemoglobinemia is a condition characterized by in-creased quantities of hemoglobin in which the iron ofheme is oxidized to the ferric (Fe
3+) form. Methemoglo-
bin is useless as an oxygen carrier and thus causes a varyingdegree of cyanosis.
WHATARETHEPOSSIBLECAUSES?
The condition may arise as a result of a genetic defect inred blood cell metabolism or hemoglobin structure, or itmay be acquired following exposure to various oxidantdrugs or toxins.
Geneticdefect
Hereditary methemoglobinemia is a rare recessively inher-ited disorder due to deficiency of an enzyme, called re-duced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cyto-chrome b
5reductase. Normal erythrocytes are well
endowed with a system to convert useless methemoglobinto functional hemoglobin. The major mechanism for thisreductive capacity resides in the soluble NADH cyto-chrome b
5reductase. The gene regulating the synthesis of
cytochrome b5reductase has been localized to chromo-
some 22q13qter, and a number of mutations have beenidentified.
1,2Hereditary methemoglobinemia due to
NADH cytochrome b5reductase deficiency is classified
into 2 types —erythrocyte (type I) and generalized (type II).
In the type I form, the soluble form of the enzyme is
deficient only in erythrocytes, and cyanosis is the onlysymptom.
3Type II hereditary methemoglobinemia is due
to deficiency of the membrane-bound form of the en-zyme, which is located in the outer mitochondrial mem-brane and the endoplasmic reticulum of somatic cells.Type II hereditary methemoglobinemia is a rare diseasecharacterized by deficiency of the enzyme in all tissues andmanifesting with severe developmental abnormalities, se-vere mental retardation, and neurologic impairment,which often lead to premature death.

ally manifest signs of methemoglobinemia. However, un-
der the stress of oxidant drugs, severe cyanosis may de-velop because of methemoglobinemia. Neurologicabnormalities do not respond to methylene blue therapy.
There are several abnormal hemoglobin variants asso-
ciated with genetic methemoglobinemia, and these aredesignated hemoglobin M. In most of the hemoglobin M,tyrosine has been substituted for either the proximal or thedistal histidine. This results in reduced capacity of theenzymatic machinery of the erythrocyte to efficiently re-duce the iron to the divalent form and thus predisposes tomethemoglobinemia. These hemoglobin variants are as-sociated with cyanosis, which is present from early life. Inthe case of the /H9251-chain variants, it is present from birth,
whereas the /H9252-chain hemoglobin variants produce cyano-
sis only after the first few months of life as adult hemo-globin synthesis becomes established. This disorder is in-herited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
Exposuretodrugsortoxins
The most common cause of methemoglobinemia, as inthis clinical case, is ingestion of or exposure of skin ormucous membranes to oxidizing agents (see box). Some ofthese oxidize hemoglobin directly to form methemo-globin; others do it indirectly by reducing free oxygento the free radical O
2/H11502, which in turn oxidizes hemoglo-
bin to methemoglobin. Outbreaks of methemoglobine-mia have occurred due to nitrite poisoning from watercontamination.
5
Large amounts of nitric oxide are released in patients
with sepsis. Nitric oxide is converted to methemoglobinand nitrate. It has been reported that methemoglobin lev-els are significantly higher in patients with sepsis than innonseptic patients.
6
Methemoglobinemia has been reported in young in-
fants (<6 months) in whom severe metabolic acidosis de-velops from diarrhea and dehydration.
7Young infants
may be particularly susceptible to this complication be-cause of their low stomach acid production, large numberof nitrite-reducing bacteria, and the relatively easy oxida-tion of fetal hemoglobin. Small infants have lower eryth-rocyte levels of cytochrome breductase.
8Higher intestinal
pH of infants may promote the growth of gram-negativeorganisms that convert dietary nitrates to nitrites.
Methemoglobinemia has been reported in diarrhea
induced by hypersensitivity to cow ’s milk proteins.
9It
has also been reported in association with renal tubularacidosis.

WHATARETHEOTHERCLINICALSIGNSAND COMPLICATIONS?Methemoglobinemia may be acute or chronic. The physi-ologic level of methemoglobin in the blood is 0% to 2%.
2
Methemoglobin concentrations of 10% to 20% are tol-erated well, but levels above this are often associated withsymptoms. Levels above 70% may cause death. Symp-toms also depend on the rapidity of its formation. Manypatients with lifelong methemoglobinemia are asymptom-atic, but patients exposed to drugs and toxins whoabruptly develop the same levels of methemoglobinemiamay be severely symptomatic.
Small infants with methemoglobinemia present with
cyanosis that fails to respond to supplemental oxygen. Cy-anosis in those with congenital methemoglobinemia usu-ally appears shortly after birth. Dyspnea, nausea, andtachycardia occur at methemoglobin levels of 30% ormore. Lethargy, stupor, and deteriorating consciousnessoccur as methemoglobin levels approach 55%. Higherlevels may cause cardiac arrhythmias and circulatory fail-ure. Hemolytic anemia may follow drug-induced methe-moglobinemia, especially with exposure to dapsone, sul-fasalazine, or phenacetin. The anemia is characterized byHeinz bodies (precipitated hemoglobin or globin subunitsdue to denaturation of hemoglobin in erythrocytes) andfragmented red blood cells. Occasionally acute intravas-cular hemolysis can lead to renal failure. Hemolytic ane-mia with jaundice may also be a feature of hemoglobinM
Saskatoon and hemoglobin MHyde Park —abnormal hemo-
globin variants associated with genetic methemoglobine-mia and identified by where they were discovered.

.........................................................................................................
WHATISTHEDIFFERENTIALDIAGNOSIS?The differential diagnosis of methemoglobinemia in smallinfants includes cyanotic congenital heart disease, particu-larly when right to left shunting is present. Children with
cyanotic congenital heart disease who receive supple-mental oxygen have a low partial pressure of oxygen
and a low calculated oxygen saturation, but children withmethemoglobinemia have a high partial pressure of oxy-gen despite cyanosis and normal calculated oxygensaturation.
Methemoglobinemia in older children should be dis-
tinguished from sulfhemoglobinemia. Sulfhemoglobine-mia refers to the incorporation of a sulfur molecule intothe heme moiety. Most drugs, particularly sulfonamidesand phenacetin, that produce methemoglobinemia canalso cause sulfhemoglobinemia, although this condition isless common than methemoglobinemia.
11Symptoms
tend to be milder than in patients with methemoglobine-mia. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated levels of sulf-hemoglobin by either spectrophotometry or gas chroma-tography-mass spectrometry. Sulfhemoglobinemia doesnot respond to methylene blue, and the treatment is sup-portive.
12In severe cases, exchange transfusion may be
useful.
The potassium cyanide test can distinguish between
methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin. After the addition ofa few drops of potassium cyanide, methemoglobin turnsbright red, but sulfhemoglobin remains dark brown. Thisis due to the binding of methemoglobin to cyanide, form-ing cyanomethemoglobin, which is bright red in color.Sulfhemoglobin, on the other hand, is inert and does notbind cyanide.
13
A family history is usually helpful in differentiating
methemoglobinemia due to NADH cytochrome b5re-
ductase deficiency from hemoglobin M disease. Cyanosisin successive generations suggests the presence of hemo-globin M; normal parents but possibly affected siblingsimplies the presence of NADH cytochrome b
5reductase
deficiency.
HOWDOYOUCONFIRMTHEDIAGNOSIS?
Blood containing high concentrations of methemoglobinappears chocolate brown. Subjects with methemoglobine-mia may have normal partial pressures of oxygen, despitelife-threatening methemoglobinemia. The oxygen satura-tion values, measured by a pulse oximeter, are falselyelevated.
In methemoglobinemia due to drug exposure, an el-
evated level of methemoglobin is found, but the activity ofNADH cytochrome b
5reductase is normal. In hereditary
type II methemoglobinemia, the enzyme ’s activity is less
than 20% of normal. Hemoglobin M may be differenti-ated from methemoglobin formed from hemoglobin A byits absorption spectrum in the range of 450 to 750 nm.Electrophoresis at pH 7.1 is most useful for the separationof hemoglobin M.

WHATTREATMENTWORKS?
The course of hereditary methemoglobinemia type I isbenign, but these patients should not be administered oxi-dant drugs. Treatment may be required for cosmetic rea-sons or for an inadvertent use of oxidant drugs. Ascorbicacid, 300 to 600 mg orally daily divided into 3 or 4 doses,is helpful.
15
For methemoglobinemia due to drug exposure, tradi-
tional first-line therapy consists of an infusion of methy-lene blue, whose action depends on the availability ofreduced nicotinamide adenine nucleotide phosphate(NADPH) within the red blood cells. After an acute ex-posure to an oxidizing agent, treatment should be consid-ered when the methemoglobin is 30% in an asymptom-atic patient and 20% in a symptomatic patient.
16Patients
with anemia or cardiorespiratory problems should betreated at lower levels of methemoglobin. Methemoglobi-nemia due to hemoglobin M does not respond to ascorbicacid or methylene blue.
Dextrose should be given
17because the major source of
NADH in the red blood cells is the catabolism of sugarthrough glycolysis. Dextrose is also necessary to formNADPH through the hexose monophosphate shunt,which is necessary for methylene blue to be effective.
Methylene blue is an oxidant; its metabolic product
leukomethylene blue is the reducing agent. Therefore,large doses of methylene blue may result in higher levels ofmethylene blue rather than the leukomethylene blue,which will result in hemolysis and, paradoxically, methe-moglobinemia in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehy-drogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
18Patients with G6PD
deficiency also may not produce sufficient NADPH toreduce methylene blue to leukomethylene blue; thus,methylene blue therapy may be ineffective in thesepatients.
18
Some drugs, such as dapsone, benzocaine, and aniline,
produce a rebound methemoglobinemia, in which met-hemoglobin levels increase 4 to 12 hours after successfulmethylene blue therapy.
19
N-Acetylcysteine, cimetidine, and ketoconazole are ex-
perimental therapies in the treatment of methemoglobi-nemia that have shown some promising results.
20-22Ex-
change transfusion is reserved for patients in whommethylene blue therapy is ineffective.
