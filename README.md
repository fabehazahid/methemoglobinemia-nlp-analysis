## 🔬 Overview

Methemoglobinemia is a hematological disorder characterized by elevated methemoglobin (MetHb) levels—an oxidized form of hemoglobin incapable of oxygen transport. Clinical data is fragmented across medical literature, making systematic analysis of trigger-severity relationships and treatment efficacy challenging. This project implements an automated NLP pipeline to extract, structure, and analyze clinical data from case reports, enabling evidence-based insights and interactive exploration.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Clinical Challenge

**Methemoglobin Pathophysiology**: Under normal conditions, methemoglobin comprises <1% of total hemoglobin due to cytochrome b5 reductase-mediated reduction. Methemoglobinemia occurs when oxidative stress overwhelms reduction capacity through:
- **Acquired causes**: Pharmaceutical agents (benzocaine, dapsone), environmental toxins (nitrates, aniline dyes)
- **Congenital causes**: Cytochrome b5 reductase deficiency, hemoglobin M variants, G6PD deficiency

**Severity Stratification**:
- <15%: Asymptomatic/mild cyanosis
- 15-30%: Dyspnea, fatigue, "saturation gap" (pulse ox ~85% despite normal PaO₂)
- 30-50%: Altered mental status, severe dyspnea
- >50%: Life-threatening (seizures, dysrhythmias, CNS depression)

### Data Gap

Key clinical questions remain unanswered due to fragmented case report literature:
- Which triggers produce the highest peak MetHb levels?
- What are typical time-to-symptom patterns by etiology?
- How does treatment response vary across trigger classes?
- Are there age-dependent risk profiles?

Manual extraction from 100+ case reports is prohibitively time-intensive for systematic review.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Data Acquisition → Text Extraction → NLP Processing → Analytics → Interactive Dashboard
     (PubMed)          (PyPDF2)      (spaCy/Regex)    (Pandas)      (Streamlit)
```

### Pipeline Components

1. **Data Acquisition Layer**
   - PubMed Entrez API for abstracts (N=27)
   - PubMed Central for open-access full-text PDFs (N=6)
   - Search strategy: `"methemoglobinemia" AND "case report"`

2. **NLP Processing Engine**
   - **Text extraction**: PyPDF2 for PDFs, UTF-8 normalization
   - **Section segmentation**: Identify "Case Presentation" to avoid background mentions
   - **Feature extraction**:
     - **MetHb levels**: Regex patterns (`methemoglobin.*?(\d+\.?\d*)\s*%`)
     - **Triggers**: Dictionary-based matching with context-aware scoring
     - **Demographics**: spaCy NER + rule-based extraction (age, gender)
     - **Treatment**: Keyword matching (methylene blue, vitamin C, exchange transfusion)
     - **Outcomes**: Classification (recovered, fatal, admitted)
   - **Context scoring**: Prioritize matches near causative phrases ("after", "induced by", "due to")

3. **Structured Data Schema**
   ```
   Variables: pmid, meth_level, trigger, treatment, age, gender, symptoms,
              outcome, g6pd_status, mb_dose, time_to_improvement,
              data_quality_score
   ```

4. **Analytics Module**
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, range, severity stratification)
   - Comparative analysis (MetHb by trigger, ANOVA)
   - Treatment efficacy (recovery rates, dose-response)
   - Correlation analysis (age-severity, quality metrics)

5. **Interactive Dashboard** (Streamlit + Plotly)
   - Dynamic filtering (trigger, age range, MetHb severity, outcomes)
   - Real-time visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)
   - Exportable data tables with applied filters

| Trigger | Cases | Mean MetHb | Severity | Key Findings |
|---------|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Dapsone** | 6 (18%) | 42.3% | Severe ⚠️ | Delayed onset (24-72h), prolonged monitoring required |
| **Benzocaine** | 8 (24%) | 28.1% | Moderate | Rapid onset (minutes), topical anesthetic exposure |
| **Acetaminophen** | 4 (12%) | 35.6% | Severe | Associated with massive overdose (>10g) |
| **Lidocaine** | 3 (9%) | 25.4% | Moderate | Injectable local anesthetic |
| **Genetic** | 2 (6%) | 15-20% | Chronic compensated | Baseline elevation, exacerbated by oxidative stress |

### Treatment Outcomes
- **Methylene blue administration**: 73% of cases (24/33)
- **Recovery rate with MB**: 96% (23/24)
- **Median response time**: 60 minutes (range: 30 min - 4 hours)
- **G6PD documentation**: Only 6% of cases explicitly mentioned (major clinical gap)

### Clinical Correlations
- **Age distribution**: Bimodal peaks at 20-30 and 60-70 years
- **Severity stratification**: 54% severe (≥30%), 36% moderate (15-30%), 11% mild (<15%)
- **Overall mortality**: 6% (2/33), both with MetHb >60% and delayed recognition

## 🏥 Clinical Significance

### Impact

**Evidence Synthesis**: Automated pipeline reduces 8-10 hours of manual review to <5 minutes, enabling rapid systematic analysis of emerging case reports.

**Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trigger-severity relationships invisible in individual case reports:
- Dapsone exhibits 50% higher mean MetHb vs. benzocaine (42.3% vs. 28.1%)
- Delayed-onset triggers (dapsone) require extended monitoring protocols

**Clinical Decision Support**: Provides point-of-care access to:
- Expected MetHb ranges by trigger
- Treatment response timelines
- Risk stratification by patient demographics

**Knowledge Gaps Identified**:
- G6PD status under-documented (6% of cases) despite MB contraindication
- Limited time-to-symptom data for most triggers
- Need for prospective dapsone monitoring studies

### Limitations

- **Sample size**: N=33 may be underpowered for rare triggers
- **Publication bias**: Severe cases over-represented (mean MetHb 37.2%)
- **NLP accuracy**: ~85-90% for key fields (validated via manual spot-checking)
- **Retrospective**: Cannot establish causality; prospective validation needed

**Clinical Disclaimer**: This tool is for research and educational purposes only. Not a substitute for clinical judgment. All treatment decisions require qualified healthcare professionals.
